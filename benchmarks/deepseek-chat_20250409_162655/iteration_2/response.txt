### Analysis of Previous Attempt
The previous design scored 72.07/100 with the following issues:
1. **Structural failure**: The rocket broke during flight, which is unacceptable.
2. **Apogee miss**: Achieved 2870.39m (5.83% below target).
3. **Cost**: $721.63 is reasonable but could be optimized.

### Key Improvements Needed
1. **Structural Reinforcement**:
   - Increase body thickness from 0.002m to 0.003m
   - Switch body material from fiberglass to carbon_fiber (higher strength-to-weight)
   - Increase fin thickness from 0.005m to 0.007m

2. **Apogee Adjustment**:
   - The Pro75M1670 motor was slightly underpowered. Switch to CesaroniM1670 (same impulse but heavier, which helps with stability)
   - Reduce drag by:
     - Lengthening nose cone (0.4m → 0.5m)
     - Reducing fin span (0.3m → 0.25m)

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Use plywood for fins instead of carbon fiber (80% cheaper)
   - Keep carbon fiber only for high-stress areas (body)

4. **Recovery System**:
   - Increase main chute Cd_s from 0.5 to 0.7 for softer landing
   - Add slight launch angle (85°) to counter 5 m/s east wind

### Revised Design Calculations
- **Mass Estimate**:
  - Body: π*(0.08² - 0.077²)*1.5*1600 kg/m³ (carbon fiber) ≈ 3.5 kg
  - Motor: 3.101 kg (CesaroniM1670)
  - Total ≈ 7 kg → Needs larger parachute

- **Stability**:
  - Increased body length (1.5m → 1.7m) for better CP-CG margin
  - 4 fins with 1° cant angle for gentle spin stabilization

### Expected Performance
1. **Apogee**: ~3050m (better match due to reduced drag and slightly more mass)
2. **Structure**: Carbon fiber body and thicker fins prevent failure
3. **Cost**: ~$650 (saved $70 by using plywood fins)
4. **Landing**: Larger chute ensures <5 m/s impact
5. **Wind Compensation**: 5° inclination reduces horizontal drift

This design should score >85/100 by addressing all failure modes while optimizing cost and performance.
