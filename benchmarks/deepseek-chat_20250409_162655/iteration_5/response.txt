### Analysis of Previous Attempts

1. **Key Observations**:
   - **Motor**: Pro75M1670 consistently outperformed CesaroniM1670 despite identical impulse (lighter dry mass).
   - **Structure**: Fiberglass body at 0.0035m thickness prevented failures but may still be slightly overbuilt.
   - **Apogee**: All attempts undershot target (best was 2826m in Attempt 3).
   - **Cost**: $650-$690 range is acceptable but could be optimized further.

2. **Root Causes for Apogee Shortfall**:
   - Excessive drag from nose cone length (0.38m in Attempt 4)
   - Overly conservative fin design (0.26m span still creates drag)
   - Slightly overweight body (fiberglass at 0.0035m)

### Optimized Design Strategy

1. **Motor Selection**:
   - **Pro75M1670** remains optimal (6023.6 Ns impulse, 1.815 kg dry mass).

2. **Structural Improvements**:
   - **Body**: Reduce thickness to 0.0032m (still safe based on Attempt 3's 0.003m success).
   - **Fins**: Switch to **balsa_wood** (lighter than plywood, sufficient for this flight profile).
   - **Tail**: Keep aluminum but reduce length to 0.25m.

3. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - **Nose Cone**: Shorten to 0.34m (elliptical shape for lower drag).
   - **Fins**: Reduce span to 0.22m (minimum stable configuration).
   - **Cant Angle**: Increase to 2° for better spin stabilization.

4. **Recovery System**:
   - **Main Chute**: Cd_s = 0.62 (balance between drift and landing speed).
   - **Drogue Chute**: Cd_s = 0.18 (smaller to reduce drift).

5. **Wind Compensation**:
   - **Inclination**: 87° (3° into wind).
   - **Heading**: 5° east (better compensation for 5 m/s wind).

6. **Mass Reduction**:
   - Estimated total mass: ~5.2 kg (lighter than Attempt 4's 5.8 kg).

### Expected Performance

1. **Apogee**: 3030-3080m (99-101% of target)
   - Achieved through:
     - Reduced drag (shorter nose cone + smaller fins)
     - Lighter structure (balsa wood fins, thinner body)
     - Better mass distribution

2. **Structural Integrity**: PASS
   - Fiberglass at 0.0032m is proven safe (Attempt 3's 0.003m worked)
   - Aluminum tail provides necessary reinforcement

3. **Cost**: ~$620
   - Balsa wood fins save ~$50 vs plywood
   - Fiberglass body remains cost-effective

4. **Landing**: <5 m/s
   - Main chute Cd_s = 0.62 ensures safe descent
   - Drogue chute reduced to minimize drift

5. **Wind Handling**:
   - 3° tilt + 5° heading reduces drift by ~50%

### Predicted Score: 92-97/100
This design addresses all scoring criteria:
- **Distance**: Hits target apogee within 1%
- **Cost**: $620 (cost_reward ≈ 0.8)
- **Landing**: Safe impact velocity (impact_reward ≈ 1)
- **Structure**: No failure (structural_failure_reward = 1)
- **Drift**: Minimal horizontal distance (horz_distance_reward ≈ 0.95)
