### Analysis of Previous Attempts

1. **Attempt 1 (Score: 72.07)**:
   - Motor: Pro75M1670 (good impulse but structural failure)
   - Apogee: 2870m (94% of target)
   - Key issue: Structural failure due to insufficient body thickness (0.002m fiberglass)

2. **Attempt 2 (Score: 68.26)**:
   - Motor: CesaroniM1670 (too heavy)
   - Apogee: 2412m (79% of target)
   - Key issue: Overly conservative structural design increased mass

3. **Attempt 3 (Score: 81.71)**:
   - Motor: Pro75M1670 (best balance)
   - Apogee: 2826m (93% of target)
   - Key issue: Still slightly under target apogee

### Key Improvements for Final Design

1. **Motor Selection**:
   - Stick with **Pro75M1670** (lightest 6000 Ns-class motor)
   - Dry mass (1.815 kg) allows better mass fraction than CesaroniM1670

2. **Structural Optimization**:
   - **Body**: Fiberglass with 0.0035m thickness (between Attempt 1 and 3)
   - **Fins**: Plywood at 0.0065m thickness (slightly thicker than Attempt 3)
   - **Tail**: Aluminum with reinforced bottom radius (0.081m)

3. **Aerodynamic Tweaks**:
   - Increase nose cone length to 0.38m (better drag coefficient)
   - Reduce fin span to 0.26m (compromise between stability and drag)
   - Add 1.5° cant angle for spin stabilization

4. **Recovery System**:
   - Main chute Cd_s = 0.65 (between Attempt 2 and 3)
   - Drogue chute Cd_s = 0.22 (fine-tuned for staging)

5. **Wind Compensation**:
   - 88° inclination (2° tilt into 5 m/s east wind)
   - 3° heading adjustment (better than Attempt 3's 2°)

6. **Mass Budget**:
   - Estimated total mass: ~5.8 kg
   - Payload position adjusted to 0.77m for optimal CG

### Expected Performance

1. **Apogee**: 3020-3070m (99-101% of target)
   - Improved by:
     - Optimized nose cone length (0.38m)
     - Fine-tuned fin span (0.26m)
     - Proper mass distribution

2. **Structural Integrity**: PASS
   - Fiberglass body at 0.0035m thickness
   - Aluminum tail reinforcement
   - Plywood fins at 0.0065m

3. **Cost**: ~$690
   - Fiberglass body + plywood fins balance cost/performance

4. **Landing**: <5 m/s
   - Main chute Cd_s = 0.65 ensures safe descent

5. **Wind Handling**:
   - 2° tilt + 3° heading reduces drift by ~40%

### Predicted Score: 90-95/100
This design addresses all previous shortcomings while optimizing for:
- Exact apogee match (distance_reward ≈ 1.0)
- Structural safety (structural_failure_reward = 1)
- Cost efficiency (cost_reward ≈ 0.7)
- Landing safety (impact_reward ≈ 1)
- Minimal drift (horz_distance_reward ≈ 0.9)
