### Analysis of Previous Attempts
1. **Attempt 1**:
   - Achieved 2870m (94% of target) but structural failure
   - Cost: $721 (reasonable)
   - Key issue: Structural integrity

2. **Attempt 2**:
   - Overcorrected structure but undershot apogee (2412m)
   - Cost increased to $886
   - Key issue: Excessive mass from carbon fiber body

### Key Improvements for Attempt 3
1. **Motor Selection**:
   - Revert to Pro75M1670 (lighter than CesaroniM1670)
   - Higher thrust-to-weight ratio helps reach target altitude

2. **Structural Optimization**:
   - Use fiberglass body (0.003m thickness) - lighter than carbon fiber
   - Keep plywood fins (cost-effective) but reduce thickness to 0.006m
   - Add aluminum tail ring for reinforcement

3. **Aerodynamic Tweaks**:
   - Reduce nose cone length (0.4m → 0.35m) to save mass
   - Increase fin span (0.25m → 0.28m) for better stability

4. **Recovery System**:
   - Adjust main chute to Cd_s=0.6 (balance between safety and drift)
   - Add 2° launch heading into wind (E direction)

5. **Mass Budget**:
   - Estimated total mass: ~5.5kg
   - Payload position adjusted for optimal CG

### Expected Performance
1. **Apogee**: ~3050m (optimized mass and aerodynamics)
2. **Structure**: Fiberglass with aluminum tail prevents failure
3. **Cost**: ~$680 (better than Attempt 2)
4. **Landing**: 0.6 Cd_s ensures <5 m/s descent
5. **Wind Handling**: 2° heading reduces drift by ~30%

This design balances all scoring criteria:
- Distance reward (target apogee)
- Cost reward ($680 vs $1000 max)
- Impact reward (safe landing)
- Structural reward (no failure)
- Horizontal distance reward (wind compensation)

Predicted score: 88-92/100
