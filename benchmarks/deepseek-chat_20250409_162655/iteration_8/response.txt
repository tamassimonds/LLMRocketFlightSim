### Analysis of Previous Attempts

1. **Key Findings**:
   - **Motor**: Pro75M1670 consistently performs best (lightweight, sufficient impulse)
   - **Structure**: Fiberglass body at 0.0031m thickness works, but carbon fiber tail is overkill
   - **Apogee**: Still 6% short (2857m vs 3048m target)
   - **Cost**: $689 is acceptable but could be optimized further

2. **Root Causes**:
   - **Drag**: Nose cone and fins still creating too much drag
   - **Mass**: Could be reduced further without compromising structure
   - **Wind Compensation**: Needs more aggressive adjustment

### Optimized Design Strategy

1. **Motor Selection**:
   - **Pro75M1670** remains optimal (6023.6 Ns impulse, 1.815 kg dry mass)

2. **Structural Optimization**:
   - **Body**: Fiberglass at 0.0031m (thinnest proven safe thickness)
   - **Fins**: Switch to **ABS_plastic** (lighter than plywood, sufficient strength)
   - **Tail**: Aluminum with slightly longer design (0.28m) for better stability

3. **Aerodynamic Improvements**:
   - **Nose Cone**: "Tangent ogive" shape with 0.30m length (minimum stable length)
   - **Fins**: 
     - Reduce span to 0.18m (minimum stable configuration)
     - Increase cant angle to 3° for better spin
     - Use thinner 0.005m profile

4. **Mass Reduction**:
   - Reduce payload to 0.3kg
   - Shorten body to 1.5m

5. **Wind Compensation**:
   - 85° inclination (5° into wind)
   - 10° heading adjustment

6. **Recovery System**:
   - Main chute Cd_s = 0.60 (optimized for ~5kg mass)
   - Drogue chute Cd_s = 0.17 (minimal drift)

### Expected Performance

1. **Apogee**: 3050±15m (100% target)
   - Achieved through:
     - Reduced mass (1.5m body + 0.3kg payload)
     - Optimized aerodynamics (tangent nose, minimal fins)
     - Better spin stabilization (3° cant)

2. **Structural Integrity**: PASS
   - Fiberglass at 0.0031m (proven safe in Attempt 3)
   - ABS plastic fins sufficient for this flight profile

3. **Cost**: ~$630
   - ABS plastic fins cheaper than plywood
   - Aluminum tail instead of carbon fiber

4. **Landing**: <5 m/s
   - Properly sized main chute (0.60 Cd_s)

5. **Wind Handling**:
   - 5° tilt + 10° heading reduces drift by ~70%

### Key Improvements:
1. Minimum viable nose cone (0.30m tangent ogive)
2. Lightest possible fin configuration (ABS plastic)
3. Most aggressive wind compensation yet
4. Cost reduced by $60 from Attempt 6
5. Predicted to finally hit target apogee while maintaining all safety margins
