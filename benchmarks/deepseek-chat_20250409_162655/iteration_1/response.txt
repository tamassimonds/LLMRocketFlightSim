Alright, let's tackle this rocket design step by step. I'm going to approach this like a rocket scientist, making calculations and approximations to ensure the rocket meets the target apogee of 3048 meters (which is roughly 10,000 feet, a common high-power rocketry goal) while considering wind conditions, cost, and safety.

### 1. Motor Selection
First, we need to choose a motor that can propel the rocket to approximately 3048 meters. To estimate the required impulse, we can use the rocket equation and some approximations.

**Rocket Equation:**
Δv = Isp * g₀ * ln(m₀ / m₁)

But since we don't know the mass yet, let's look at the motors' total impulse and see which one might get us close to 3 km.

Looking at the motors:
- Pro75M1670: 6023.6 Ns
- AeroTechK700W: 2249 Ns
- CesaroniM1670: 6023.6 Ns
- AeroTechH128W: 176.5 Ns (too small)
- CesaroniO3700: 29930.2 Ns (way too big)
- CesaroniO5800: 30382.7 Ns (also too big)
- CesaroniK160: 1521.7 Ns (too small)

The Pro75M1670 and CesaroniM1670 have the same total impulse (6023.6 Ns). The CesaroniM1670 is heavier (3.101 kg dry mass vs. 1.815 kg), so the Pro75M1670 is more efficient for our purposes.

**Estimated Apogee:**
For high-power rockets, a rough estimate is that 1000 Ns can get you about 500-1000 meters depending on the rocket's mass and drag. 6000 Ns could reasonably get us to 3000 meters with a well-designed rocket.

**Choice:** Pro75M1670

### 2. Rocket Body
The motor radius is 75 mm (0.075 m), so the body radius must be slightly larger. Let's choose 0.08 m (80 mm).

**Length:**
A typical ratio for stability is length to diameter of about 10:1. Diameter is 0.16 m, so length ~1.6 m. Let's go with 1.5 m for the body.

**Material:**
We want something strong but not too expensive. Fiberglass is a good balance between strength and cost.

**Thickness:**
For fiberglass, 1-2 mm is typical. Let's go with 0.002 m (2 mm).

### 3. Nose Cone
**Shape:**
An ogive shape is aerodynamically efficient.

**Length:**
Typically 2-3 times the body diameter. Body diameter is 0.16 m, so nose cone length ~0.4 m.

**Material:**
Composite is lightweight and strong, good for nose cones.

### 4. Fins
**Number:**
3 or 4 fins are common. 4 fins provide more stability.

**Dimensions:**
- Root chord: ~0.15 m
- Tip chord: ~0.075 m
- Span: ~0.3 m
- Cant angle: Small, say 0.5° for slight spin stabilization.

**Material:**
Carbon fiber is strong and lightweight, good for fins.

**Thickness:**
~0.005 m (5 mm) for strength.

### 5. Tail
**Length:**
Similar to body length, say 0.3 m.

**Radii:**
Top radius: 0.075 m (same as motor)
Bottom radius: 0.08 m (same as body)
(Note: top and bottom cannot be the same, so adjust top to 0.074 m)

**Material:**
Carbon fiber for strength.

### 6. Parachutes
**Drogue:**
For descent control before main deployment. Cd_s ~0.2 m².

**Main:**
For safe landing (<5 m/s). Assuming total mass ~5 kg, to achieve 5 m/s:
v = sqrt( (2 * m * g) / (ρ * Cd * A) )
Solving for A ~0.5 m² (Cd_s ~0.5).

### 7. Launch Rail
**Length:**
At least 1.5 times the rocket length for stability. Rocket length ~2 m (body + nose), so rail length ~3 m.

**Inclination:**
90° (vertical) for max altitude.

**Heading:**
0° (into the wind is standard, but since wind is from E, maybe slight angle, but for simplicity, 0°.

### 8. Payload
Assume a small payload, say 0.5 kg, positioned near the nose (0.7 m from center).

}
```

### Reasoning:
- **Motor**: Pro75M1670 has enough impulse to reach ~3 km without being overly heavy or expensive.
- **Body**: Sized to fit the motor, with fiberglass for cost and strength balance.
- **Nose Cone**: Ogive shape for good aerodynamics, composite for strength.
- **Fins**: 4 fins for stability, carbon fiber for lightweight strength.
- **Parachutes**: Sized to ensure safe landing speed (<5 m/s).
- **Launch Rail**: Long enough to ensure stable launch.
- **Payload**: Small mass positioned to not disrupt stability.

This design should meet the apogee target, be cost-effective, and ensure safe recovery.
