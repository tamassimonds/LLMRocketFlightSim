- \( L = 1.0 \, \text{m} \)
- \( T = 0.002 \, \text{m} \)

\[
\text{Volume} = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.08 \times 1.0 \times 0.002 \approx 0.001005 \, \text{m}^3
\]

Assuming **balsa_wood** density of **160 kg/m³**:

\[

\]

Where:
- \( R = 0.04 \, \text{m} \) (assuming top radius)
- \( L = 0.2 \, \text{m} \)

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3.1416 \times 0.04^2 \times 0.2 \approx 0.000335 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.000335 \times 160 \approx 0.054 \, \text{kg}
\]

  - **Reasoning:** Straight fins are sufficient given consistent wind conditions.

### **Material: **`balsa_wood`**
- **Reasoning:**
  - **Lightweight:** Minimizes overall rocket mass.
  - **Cost-Effective:** More affordable than composite materials.

### **Fin Thickness:** **0.0015 meters (1.5 mm)**
- **Reasoning:** Ensures structural integrity without excessive weight.

### **Mass Estimation**

Calculating per fin volume:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Root Chord} \times \text{Span} \times \text{Thickness} = 0.1 \times 0.2 \times 0.0015 = 0.00003 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.00003 \times 160 = 0.0048 \, \text{kg}
\]

Total for **3 fins**:

\]

## **5. Tail Design**

### **Dimensions**
- **Length:** **0.3 meters**
- **Top Radius:** **0.03 meters**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.04 meters**
  - **Reasoning:** Differing radii prevent simulation errors and maintain aerodynamic balance.

### **Material: **`balsa_wood`**
- **Reasoning:** Consistent with fin and nose cone materials for uniform structural integrity.

### **Mass Estimation**

Approximating the tail as a truncated cone:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi L (R_{\text{top}}^2 + R_{\text{top}} R_{\text{bottom}} + R_{\text{bottom}}^2)
\]

Where:
- \( L = 0.3 \, \text{m} \)
- \( R_{\text{top}} = 0.03 \, \text{m} \)
- \( R_{\text{bottom}} = 0.04 \, \text{m} \)

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3.1416 \times 0.3 \times (0.03^2 + 0.03 \times 0.04 + 0.04^2) \approx 0.000785 \, \text{m}^3
