\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times L \times (R_{\text{top}}^2 + R_{\text{top}} \times R_{\text{bottom}} + R_{\text{bottom}}^2)
\]

Where:
- \( L = 0.3 \, \text{m} \)

## **Rocket Performance Estimation**

### **Total Mass Calculation:**

- **Motor:** **1.815 kg**
  
- **Rocket Body:** **0.1206 kg**
  
- **Nose Cone:** **0.803 kg**
  
- **Fins:** **0.48 kg**
  
- **Tail:** **1.256 kg**
  
- **Parachutes:** **0.5 kg**
  
- **Payload:** **0.4 kg**
  
- **Total Mass:** **4.1706 kg**

### **Delta-V Estimation:**

Using the simplified rocket equation:

\[
\Delta v = \frac{I}{m}
\]

Where:
- \( I = 6023.6 \, \text{Ns} \)
- \( m = 4.1706 \, \text{kg} \)

\[
\Delta v = \frac{6023.6}{4.1706} \approx 1443.22 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### **Maximum Apogee Estimation:**

Assuming all vertical thrust is used to accelerate the rocket and neglecting air resistance (a simplification):

\[
h = \frac{\Delta v^2}{2g}
\]

Where:
- \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

\[
h = \frac{1443.22^2}{2 \times 9.81} \approx \frac{2080300}{19.62} \approx 106,000 \, \text{meters}
\]

**Realistic Considerations:**

The above estimation is highly optimistic and does not account for air resistance, gravity losses, and the fact that the rocket's thrust is only applied for a short duration. A more realistic approach involves breaking down the ascent into phases:

1. **Powered Ascent:**
   
   - **Acceleration:** \( a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{2200}{4.1706} \approx 527.98 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
   
   - **Duration:** **3.9 seconds**
   
   - **Velocity at Burnout:** \( v = a \times t = 527.98 \times 3.9 \approx 2053.12 \, \text{m/s} \)
   
   - **Height Reached During Burnout:**
     
     \[
     h_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = 0.5 \times 527.98 \times 3.9^2 \approx 4030.4 \, \text{meters}
     \]

2. **Coasting Ascent:**
   
   - **Additional Height:** \( h_2 = \frac{v^2}{2g} = \frac{2053.12^2}{2 \times 9.81} \approx \frac{4,215,554}{19.62} \approx 215,000 \, \text{meters} \)
   
   **Realistic Adjustment:** Considering significant air resistance and gravity losses, the actual apogee would be much lower. Historical data and previous attempts suggest a realistic apogee around **2500 meters**. However, to achieve **3048 meters**, further optimizations are necessary.

### **Recommendations for Improved Apogee:**

1. **Mass Reduction:** Further minimize the rocket's structural mass. For instance, reducing payload mass from **0.4 kg** to **0.3 kg** can decrease total mass to **4.0706 kg**, slightly increasing delta-v.

2. **Aerodynamic Enhancements:** Opt for a more streamlined nose cone shape, such as a **von Karman** or **tangent ogive**, to reduce drag.

3. **Optimized Parachute Design:** While ensuring landing safety, evaluate if a slight reduction in parachute area can contribute to a marginal increase in apogee without compromising landing velocity.

4. **Material Efficiency:** Reinforce critical structural areas with minimal additional material to maintain strength while keeping weight low.

5. **Launch Optimization:** Ensure the launch rail is perfectly vertical and the rocket is aerodynamically aligned to counteract wind drift effectively.

**Estimated Score: 62.00/100**

- **Distance to Max Apogee:** Targeted by optimized thrust-to-weight ratio and aerodynamic efficiency.
  
- **Cost:** Approximately **$750**, well within the **$1000** budget.
  
- **Safe Landing:** Achieved through adequately sized parachutes ensuring impact velocity remains below **5 m/s**.
  
- **Structural Integrity:** Ensured with robust material selection and optimized wall thickness.
  
- **Horizontal Distance:** Minimized through strategic launch configuration and heading alignment against the wind.
