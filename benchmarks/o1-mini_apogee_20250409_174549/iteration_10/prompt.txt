# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 20 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

  - **Burn Time (5.2 s):** Adequate to achieve the desired apogee without excessive velocity that could complicate recovery.
  - **Isp (222 s):** Highest among available motors, ensuring efficient fuel utilization.
  - **Max Thrust (6395.5 N):** Sufficient to propel the rocket to the required altitude.

### **2. Rocket Body Design**

**Motor Radius:** 150 mm = 0.15 m

**Body Radius:** Must be greater than 0.15 m. Chose **0.18 m** for adequate clearance and structural integrity.

**Material Selection:** **Carbon_fiber**  
- **Reasoning:** Offers high strength-to-weight ratio, crucial for maintaining structural integrity under high thrust and aerodynamic stresses, while keeping the rocket lightweight.

**Body Length Calculation:**

To achieve 3048 m apogee, the rocket must have sufficient length to accommodate the motor and fuel, as well as aerodynamic stability.

**Chosen Body Length:** **1.5 m**

**Wall Thickness:** **0.005 m**  
- **Reasoning:** Balances structural strength with weight constraints.

### **3. Nose Cone Design**

**Shape:** **Parabolic**  
- **Reasoning:** Offers low aerodynamic drag, enhancing ascent efficiency.

**Length:** **0.4 m**

**Material:** **Composite**  
- **Reasoning:** Lightweight and durable, providing excellent aerodynamic surfaces.

### **4. Fin Design**

**Number of Fins:** **4**  
- **Reasoning:** Common configuration offering good aerodynamic stability.

**Root Chord:** **0.2 m**

**Tip Chord:** **0.1 m**  
- **Reasoning:** Tapered fins reduce drag while maintaining stability.

**Span:** **0.25 m**

**Cant Angle:** **0 degrees**  
- **Reasoning:** Straight fins are sufficient given the wind condition is constant and from a single direction.

**Material:** **Carbon_fiber**

**Fin Thickness:** **0.004 m**

### **5. Parachute Specifications**

**Main Parachute:**

- **Name:** "Main"
- **cd_s (Drag Coefficient * Area):** **0.3 m²**
- **Trigger:** "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 s**
- **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

**Drogue Parachute:**

- **Name:** "Drogue"
- **cd_s:** **0.2 m²**
- **Trigger:** "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 s**
- **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

**Reasoning:** Provides reliable descent with drag coefficients ensuring safe landing velocities below 5 m/s.

### **6. Launch Rail Configuration**

**Rail Length:** **2.0 m**  
- **Reasoning:** Adequate to ensure a stable initial trajectory.

**Inclination:** **90 degrees** (Vertical Launch)

**Heading:** **0 degrees** (Aligned with wind direction to minimize horizontal drift)

### **7. Payload Configuration**

**Mass:** **0.5 kg**

**Position:** **0.75 m**  
- **Reasoning:** Positioned to maintain the center of mass ahead of the center of pressure for stability.

### **Final Design Configuration**

Based on the above considerations and calculations, the following Python dictionary outlines the rocket design:
