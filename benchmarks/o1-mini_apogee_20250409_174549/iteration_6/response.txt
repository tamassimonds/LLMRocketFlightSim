\]

Where:
- \( R = 0.16 \, \text{m} \)
- \( L = 1.2 \, \text{m} \)
- \( T = 0.002 \, \text{m} \)

\[
\text{Volume} = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.16 \times 1.2 \times 0.002 \approx 0.00305 \, \text{m}^3
\]

Assuming **composite** density of **1600 kg/m³**:

\[

\]

\[
\text{Mass} \approx 0.000134 \times 1600 \approx 0.215 \, \text{kg}
\]

*Note: This estimation assumes a simplified ogive shape for mass calculation.*

### **Material: **`fiberglass`**

- **Reasoning:** 
  - **Strength & Weight:** Provides strong, lightweight fins that can withstand aerodynamic stresses without significant mass.
  - **Cost Efficiency:** More affordable than carbon fiber, aiding in budget adherence.

### **Fin Thickness:** **0.0015 meters (1.5 mm)**

- **Reasoning:** Ensures fin strength without adding unnecessary weight or cost.

### **Mass Estimation**

Calculating per fin volume:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Root Chord} \times \text{Span} \times \text{Thickness} = 0.15 \times 0.3 \times 0.0015 = 0.0000675 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.0000675 \times 1600 \approx 0.108 \, \text{kg}
\]

Total for **4 fins**:

\[
0.108 \times 4 = 0.432 \, \text{kg}
\]

---

## **5. Tail Design**

### **Dimensions**

- **Length:** **0.5 meters**
- **Top Radius:** **0.04 meters**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.05 meters**
  - **Reasoning:** Differing radii prevent simulation errors and maintain aerodynamic balance.

### **Material: **`fiberglass`**

- **Reasoning:** 
  - **Consistency:** Matches fin material for uniform structural integrity and aerodynamic performance.
  - **Strength & Weight:** Ensures the tail can withstand aerodynamic forces without significant mass addition.

### **Mass Estimation**

Assuming the tail is a cylindrical section with differing radii:

\[
\text{Average Radius} = \frac{0.04 + 0.05}{2} = 0.045 \, \text{m}
\]

\[
\text{Volume} = \pi \times R^2 \times L = 3.1416 \times 0.045^2 \times 0.5 \approx 0.00318 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.00318 \times 1600 \approx 5.09 \, \text{kg}
\]

*Note: Simplified calculation assuming uniform cylindrical shape.*
