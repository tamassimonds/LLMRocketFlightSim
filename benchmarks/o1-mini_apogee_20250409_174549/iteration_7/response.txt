\]
\[
\text{Mass} = 0.000602 \times 160 \approx 0.096 \, \text{kg}
\]

### **3. Nose Cone Design**

**Shape:** **`conical`**

**Reasoning:**
- **Aerodynamic Efficiency:** Minimizes drag, enhancing ascent efficiency.
- **Simplicity:** Easier to manufacture and attach compared to more complex shapes.

\]
\[
\text{Mass} = 0.00002 \times 160 = 0.0032 \, \text{kg}
\]
\[
\text{Total Mass for 3 Fins} = 0.0032 \times 3 = 0.0096 \, \text{kg}
\]
