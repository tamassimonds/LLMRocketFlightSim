## **2. Rocket Body Design**

### **Material Selection: `balsa_wood`**

**Reasoning:**
- **Lightweight:** Significantly reduces overall rocket mass, crucial for maximizing ascent performance.
- **Cost-Effective:** More affordable compared to materials like carbon fiber or composite.
- **Adequate Strength:** Provides sufficient structural integrity when properly reinforced.

### **Dimensions:**

- **Radius:** **0.08 meters**
  - **Constraint:** Must exceed the motor radius of **0.075 meters**.
  - **Optimization:** Minimizing radius reduces mass while maintaining necessary clearance.
  
- **Length:** **0.8 meters**
  - **Reasoning:** Balances the need for sufficient space for payload and structural components without adding unnecessary mass.
  
- **Wall Thickness:** **0.0015 meters (1.5 mm)**
  - **Reasoning:** Balances structural strength with weight reduction.

### **Mass Estimation:**

Using the formula for the volume of a hollow cylinder:

\[
\text{Volume} = 2 \times \pi \times R \times L \times T
\]

Where:
- \( R = 0.08 \, \text{m} \)
- \( L = 0.8 \, \text{m} \)
- \( T = 0.0015 \, \text{m} \)

\[
\text{Volume} = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.08 \times 0.8 \times 0.0015 \approx 0.000602 \, \text{m}^3
\]

Assuming **balsa_wood** density of **160 kg/m³**:

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.000602 \times 160 \approx 0.096 \, \text{kg}
\]

### **Structural Integrity:**

- **Reinforcement:** Using internal bracing or lightweight reinforcement materials can enhance the structural integrity without significantly increasing weight.
- **Manufacturing Precision:** Ensures uniform wall thickness and minimizes weak points.

## **3. Nose Cone Design**

### **Shape: `conical`**

**Reasoning:**

- **Material:** **`balsa_wood`**
  - **Lightweight & Durable:** Ensures minimal mass addition while maintaining structural integrity.

### **Mass Estimation:**

Approximating the nose cone as a simple cone:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times R^2 \times L
\]

Where:
- \( R = 0.04 \, \text{m} \) (assuming top radius)
- \( L = 0.2 \, \text{m} \)

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3.1416 \times 0.04^2 \times 0.2 \approx 0.000335 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.000335 \times 160 \approx 0.054 \, \text{kg}
\]

## **4. Fin Design**

### **Configuration: Tri-Fin**

**Reasoning:**
- **Aerodynamic Stability:** Provides sufficient stability while minimizing material usage and weight compared to quad-fin configurations.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Fewer fins reduce material and manufacturing costs.

### **Dimensions:**

- **Number of Fins:** **3**
- **Root Chord:** **0.1 meters**
- **Tip Chord:** **0.05 meters**
- **Span:** **0.2 meters**
- **Cant Angle:** **0 degrees**
- **Thickness:** **0.001 meters (1 mm)**
- **Material:** **`balsa_wood`**

### **Mass Estimation per Fin:**

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Root Chord} \times \text{Span} \times \text{Thickness} = 0.1 \times 0.2 \times 0.001 = 0.00002 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.00002 \times 160 = 0.0032 \, \text{kg}
\]

\[
\text{Total Mass for 3 Fins} = 0.0032 \times 3 = 0.0096 \, \text{kg}
\]

### **Structural Integrity:**

- **Reinforcement:** Incorporating internal ribs or lightweight reinforcement can enhance fin durability.
- **Symmetrical Design:** Ensures balanced aerodynamic forces during flight.

## **5. Tail Design**

### **Dimensions:**

- **Length:** **0.2 meters**
- **Top Radius:** **0.025 meters**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.035 meters**
- **Material:** **`balsa_wood`**

### **Mass Estimation:**

Approximating the tail as a truncated cone:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times L \times (R_{\text{top}}^2 + R_{\text{top}} R_{\text{bottom}} + R_{\text{bottom}}^2)
\]

Where:
- \( L = 0.2 \, \text{m} \)
- \( R_{\text{top}} = 0.025 \, \text{m} \)
- \( R_{\text{bottom}} = 0.035 \, \text{m} \)

\[
\text{Volume} \approx \frac{1}{3} \times 3.1416 \times 0.2 \times (0.025^2 + 0.025 \times 0.035 + 0.035^2) \approx 0.00049 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.00049 \times 160 \approx 0.078 \, \text{kg}
\]

### **Structural Integrity:**

- **Symmetrical Design:** Ensures balanced aerodynamic forces.
- **Reinforcement:** Internal bracing can enhance strength without adding significant weight.
