**Selection Criteria:**

- **Total Impulse:** Higher total impulse indicates more energy, potentially achieving greater apogee.
- **Burn Time:** Balanced to optimize the thrust phase for apogee.
- **Isp (Specific Impulse):** Higher Isp indicates more efficient fuel usage.

**Chosen Motor: **`CesaroniO5800`**

- **Reasoning:**
  - **Highest Total Impulse (30382.7 Ns):** Provides substantial thrust duration.
  - **Burn Time (5.2 s):** Adequate to achieve the desired apogee without excessive velocity that could complicate recovery.
  - **Isp (222 s):** Highest among available motors, ensuring efficient fuel utilization.
  - **Max Thrust (6395.5 N):** Sufficient to propel the rocket to the required altitude.

### **2. Rocket Body Design**

**Motor Radius:** 150 mm = 0.15 m

**Body Radius:** Must be greater than 0.15 m. Chose **0.18 m** for adequate clearance and structural integrity.

**Material Selection:** **Carbon_fiber**  
- **Reasoning:** Offers high strength-to-weight ratio, crucial for maintaining structural integrity under high thrust and aerodynamic stresses, while keeping the rocket lightweight.

**Body Length Calculation:**

To achieve 3048 m apogee, the rocket must have sufficient length to accommodate the motor and fuel, as well as aerodynamic stability.

**Chosen Body Length:** **1.5 m**

**Wall Thickness:** **0.005 m**  
- **Reasoning:** Balances structural strength with weight constraints.

### **3. Nose Cone Design**

**Shape:** **Parabolic**

**Length:** **0.4 m**

**Material:** **Composite**  
- **Reasoning:** Lightweight and durable, providing excellent aerodynamic surfaces.

### **4. Fin Design**

**Number of Fins:** **4**  
- **Reasoning:** Common configuration offering good aerodynamic stability.

**Root Chord:** **0.2 m**

**Tip Chord:** **0.1 m**  
- **Reasoning:** Tapered fins reduce drag while maintaining stability.

**Span:** **0.25 m**

**Cant Angle:** **0 degrees**  
- **Reasoning:** Straight fins are sufficient given the wind condition is constant and from a single direction.

**Material:** **Carbon_fiber**

**Fin Thickness:** **0.004 m**

### **5. Parachute Specifications**

**Main Parachute:**

- **Name:** "Main"
- **cd_s (Drag Coefficient * Area):** **0.3 m²**
- **Trigger:** "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 s**
- **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

**Drogue Parachute:**

- **Name:** "Drogue"
- **cd_s:** **0.2 m²**
- **Trigger:** "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 s**
- **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

**Reasoning:** Provides reliable descent with drag coefficients ensuring safe landing velocities below 5 m/s.

### **6. Launch Rail Configuration**

**Rail Length:** **2.0 m**  
- **Reasoning:** Adequate to ensure a stable initial trajectory.

**Inclination:** **90 degrees** (Vertical Launch)

**Heading:** **0 degrees** (Aligned with wind direction to minimize horizontal drift)

### **7. Payload Configuration**

**Mass:** **0.5 kg**

**Position:** **0.75 m**  
- **Reasoning:** Positioned to maintain the center of mass ahead of the center of pressure for stability.
