### **Mass Estimation**

Using the formula for the volume of a hollow cylinder:

\[

\]

Where:
- \( R = 0.16 \, \text{m} \)
- \( L = 1.2 \, \text{m} \)
- \( T = 0.0015 \, \text{m} \)

\[
\text{Volume} = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.16 \times 1.2 \times 0.0015 \approx 0.00181 \, \text{m}^3
\]

Assuming **carbon_fiber** density of **1600 kg/m³**:

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.00181 \times 1600 \approx 2.90 \, \text{kg}
\]

## **3. Nose Cone Design**

- **Reasoning:** Lightweight and durable, providing excellent aerodynamic surfaces without adding excessive weight.

### **Mass Estimation**

Approximating the nose cone as an ogive:

\[
\text{Volume} \approx \frac{2}{3} \pi R^3 \approx \frac{2}{3} \times 3.1416 \times 0.04^3 \approx 0.000134 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
\text{Mass} \approx 0.000134 \times 1600 \approx 0.215 \, \text{kg}
\]

*Note: This estimation assumes a simplified ogive shape for mass calculation.*

## **4. Fin Design**

### **Configuration**

- **Number of Fins:** **4**
  
  - **Reasoning:** A quad-fin configuration offers optimal aerodynamic stability, especially under high wind conditions.

### **Dimensions**

- **Root Chord:** **0.15 meters**
- **Tip Chord:** **0.075 meters**
- **Span:** **0.3 meters**
- **Cant Angle:** **0 degrees**
  
  - **Reasoning:** Tapered fins reduce drag while maintaining structural integrity and stability.

### **Material: **`carbon_fiber`**

- **Reasoning:** Provides strong, lightweight fins that can withstand aerodynamic stresses without significant weight additions.

### **Fin Thickness:** **0.0015 meters (1.5 mm)**

- **Reasoning:** Ensures fin strength without adding unnecessary weight or cost.

### **Mass Estimation**

Calculating per fin:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Root Chord} \times \text{Span} \times \text{Thickness} = 0.15 \times 0.3 \times 0.0015 = 0.0000675 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.0000675 \times 1600 \approx 0.108 \, \text{kg}
\]

Total for **4 fins**:

\[
0.108 \times 4 = 0.432 \, \text{kg}
\]

## **5. Tail Design**

### **Dimensions**

- **Length:** **0.4 meters**
- **Top Radius:** **0.035 meters**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.045 meters**
  
  - **Reasoning:** Differing top and bottom radii prevent simulation errors and maintain aerodynamic balance.

### **Material: **`carbon_fiber`**

- **Reasoning:** Consistent with fin material for uniform structural integrity and aerodynamic performance.

### **Mass Estimation**

Assuming the tail is a cylindrical section with differing radii:

\[
\text{Average Radius} = \frac{0.035 + 0.045}{2} = 0.04 \, \text{m}
\]

\[
\text{Volume} = \pi \times R^2 \times L = 3.1416 \times 0.04^2 \times 0.4 \approx 0.002016 \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
