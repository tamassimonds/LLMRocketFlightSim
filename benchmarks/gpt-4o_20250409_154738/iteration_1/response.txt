To design a rocket that meets the requirements specified, we need to carefully choose the motor and other components, ensuring they work together to achieve a target apogee of 3048 meters while also considering safety, cost-effectiveness, and structural integrity. Let's analyze each component of the rocket step by step:

### Motor Selection

We need a motor that can provide sufficient thrust to reach the target apogee. From the available options:

- **Cesaroni K160**: With 190.2 N average thrust and a total impulse of 1521.7 Ns. This is on the lower end but suitable for smaller rockets.
- **AeroTech K700W**: Provides 658.7 N average thrust and a total impulse of 2249 Ns with a higher power, making it a good candidate.
- **Cesaroni O5800**: Provides very high thrust but will likely exceed the required apogee and increase costs and structural requirements.

Given that we have a moderate apogee target, the **AeroTech K700W** seems a good balance for our apogee goal and cost.

### Rocket Body

The rocket body must safely house the selected motor while maintaining structural integrity:

- **Radius**: The AeroTech K700W motor has a 54 mm (0.054 m) diameter, so the rocket body should have a radius greater than that. We'll choose 0.06 m for some leeway.
- **Length**: A length of about 1.5 meters should suffice to accommodate the motor and allow aerodynamic fin placement.
- **Material**: Composite offers a good balance between weight and strength, essential for cost-effectiveness.
- **Thickness**: A reasonable thickness for the material would be 0.005 m, providing structural support without excessive weight.

### Aerodynamics

#### Nose Cone

- **Shape**: An ogive shape is aerodynamic and simple to manufacture, providing low drag for better altitude performance.
- **Length**: Selecting approximately 0.3 meters to give a smooth aerodynamic profile.
- **Material**: Composite for the same reasons as the rocket body.

#### Fins

We aim for stability and minimal air drag:

- **Number**: 3 fins are generally sufficient for stability.
- **Root Chord**: 0.2 meters to provide enough surface for stability.
- **Tip Chord**: 0.1 meters, smaller for reduced drag.
- **Span**: 0.3 meters, enough to stabilize without excessive weight.
- **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees, as any angle would induce roll unnecessarily for this design.
- **Material**: Carbon fiber for stiffness and durability.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 meters to withstand forces without excess weight.

#### Tail

Allows for minimal drag:

- **Length**: 0.1 meters.
- **Top Radius**: 0.03 meters.
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.06 meters.
- **Material**: Carbon fiber for rigidity.

### Parachute Design

- **Main Parachute**:
  - **cd_s**: 0.3, sufficient to slow the descent.
- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - **cd_s**: 0.2, deployed at apogee for initial stabilization.

### Launch Rail Configuration

- **Rail Length**: 2 meters, enough to stabilize before lift-off.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees, vertical for maximum altitude.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees for straight ascent.

### Payload

- **Mass**: 0.5 kg, simulating a simple science payload.
- **Position**: 0.75 meters from the center, ensuring stability in flight dynamics.

Now, compiling these choices:

```python

    },
    "launch": {

    },
    "payload": {

}
```

This design keeps within reasonable limits for cost and ensures a safe recovery velocity while targeting the desired apogee.
