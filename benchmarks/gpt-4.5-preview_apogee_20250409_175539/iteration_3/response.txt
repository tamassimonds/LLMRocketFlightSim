Below is my rigorous reasoning for this rocket design, taking into account lessons from the previous design attempts and ensuring precise, optimized parameters to achieve exactly our target apogee of 1000m, safe landing (<5 m/s), affordability, landing accuracy via wind drift compensation, and structural integrity.

## 🚀 Step 1: Motor Selection (Critical)

Previous attempts had:

- AeroTech K700W: significantly overshot due to excessive impulse.
- Cesaroni K160: Long burn, lower thrust, fell short or imprecise.

Considering above insights, re-evaluation:

- **AeroTech K700W** has slightly higher impulse (2249Ns) but short burn (3.5s). It slightly overshoots if built too small/light.  
- **Cesaroni K160** has lower total impulse (1521.7Ns) and longer burn (9.7s). Earlier struggles indicate it provides borderline performance if not completely mass-optimized.

**Decision:**  
We select Cesaroni K160 again, but this time we optimize more aggressively on mass reduction (carbon fiber everywhere) to reliably achieve ~1000 m precisely due to its gentler, more controlled thrust profile. K160 is eminently suited with careful mass/dimensions.

## 🛰️ Step 2: Body & Materials Optimization

- Motor radius: 27mm → Body radius ≥30mm minimal. Choose **0.033m**, slightly larger than motor radius, allowing safe clearance but minimal frontal area → lower drag.
- Length-to-diameter ratio: ~16 optimal → Length = ~16 × diameter = 16 × (2 × 0.033m) = **1.056m** (rounded 1.05m).
- Material: **carbon_fiber** (strongest/stiffest/lightest available) allows thinner walls. Choose wall thickness of **0.0018m** (1.8 mm, safely strong enough structurally due to carbon stiffness, dramatically cuts mass).

---

## 🚩 Step 3: Nose Cone Optimization:

- Shape: **Ogive** proven optimal aerodynamic shape for subsonic stability, lower drag coefficient.
- Optimal nose cone Length ~3.5x body diameter = **0.231m**. (Rounded to 0.23m to simplify machining).
- Material: carbon_fiber again minimizes mass, increasing precise altitude accuracy.

---

## 🛩️ Step 4: Aerodynamic Fin Optimization:

Given previous experiences, slight adjustment ensures strong aerodynamic stability under moderate (5 m/s) wind.

- Number of fins: 3 fins lowest drag/stability tradeoff optimal at these smaller scales. (previously 4; now 3 to reduce drag/mass).
- Increased fin area slightly ensures reliable stability: Root chord: **0.12m**, Tip chord: **0.06m**, Span: **0.1m**, cant_angle small **0.5 degrees** to minimize unnecessary drag/spin.
- Thickness minimized safely (0.002m), material carbon_fiber reducing weight significantly

---

## 📏 Step 5: Tail Section Optimization:
Minimal fairing, smooth airflow transition onto fins:

- Length tail minimal/smooth transition: 0.06 m
- Bottom radius match body: 0.033 m
- Top radius slightly smaller taper for aerodynamics: 0.028 m
- Material carbon_fiber matches body construction, structural integrity yet minimal mass

---

## 🎈 Step 6: Parachute Sizing (Safe landing <5m/s):

Clarified mass estimation:  
- Empty carbon fiber rocket ~1.8 kg total (significantly lighter due to aggressive carbon optimization)
- Motor dry 0.7kg; propellant ~0.85kg; payload 0.5kg  
- Total mass at burnout: ~3.85 kg (lighter overall, improved safety)

Parachute sizing calculation (ensure landing slower than 5 m/s): 

\[ v^2 = (2 × m × g)/(ρ × cd × A) \]

Solve for A (cd ~1.5, standard parachute; ρ=1.225 kg/m³):

\[ A = (2 × 3.85 kg × 9.81 m/s²) / (1.225 kg/m³ × 1.5 × (5m/s)²) \approx 0.82 m² \]

Thus main chute (**cd_s=0.82m²**) exactly meets <5 m/s safety perfectly. Drogue chute small stabilization (**cd_s=0.2m²** adequately stabilizes during rapid initial descent without huge drift).

---

## 🎯 Step 7: Launch Rail Settings & Trajectory Optimization:

- Slightly longer rail (4 m) achieves stable velocity smoothly.
- Inclination set near vertical (90 degrees), small angle (89 degrees) for slight horizontal travel aiding landing target at (3000m, 5000m).
- Heading match southwest direction (~30 degrees) compensates perfectly east-wind drift.

---

## 🚚 Step 8: Payload Integration (CG optimization):

- 0.5kg payload precisely centered (**0.525 m from rocket center along length** ensures ideal stability, multipoint stability margin sufficient but not excessive).
