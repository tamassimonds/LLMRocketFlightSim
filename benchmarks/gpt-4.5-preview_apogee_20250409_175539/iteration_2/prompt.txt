# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Landing Position**: (3000.0m, 5000.0m) - land as close as possible to these coordinates
- **Target Apogee: 1000.0m
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
# Apogee accuracy (25% of total score)
    apogee_error_percent = abs(actual_apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee * 100
    apogee_reward = math.exp(-0.5 * (apogee_error_percent / 20)**2)  # 20% error = 1 sigma
    
    # Cost efficiency (15% of total score)
    cost_reward = math.exp(-0.5 * (total_cost / 1000)**2)  # Scale based on expected cost range
    
    # Safety (20% of total score)
    if structural_failure:
        safety_reward = 0.0
    else:
        # Impact velocity component
        safe_velocity = 10.0  # m/s
        velocity_reward = math.exp(-0.5 * ((impact_velocity - safe_velocity) / 5)**2)
        safety_reward = velocity_reward
    
    # Calculate weighted total reward
    total_reward = (
        0.45 * landing_reward +    # Landing accuracy
        0.35 * apogee_reward +     # Apogee accuracy
        0.15 * cost_reward +       # Cost efficiency
        0.05 * safety_reward       # Safety

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

# Design Justification & Engineering Reasoning

### Step 1: Motor Selection

The target apogee is 1000 meters, placing it clearly within the mid-power range. Let's evaluate the available motors:

- **Pro75M1670, CesaroniM1670, CesaroniO3700, O5800** are far too powerful and will greatly overshoot a 1 km apogee.
- **AeroTechH128W** has too low impulse (~176 Ns), likely too small for achieving the target altitude given structural mass and drag.
- **CesaroniK160** (~1521 Ns), is moderate, providing steady thrust over a 9.7s burn, but could fall slightly short of reaching 1 km apogee.
- **AeroTechK700W** (~2249 Ns) provides a good compromise of thrust and impulse and could be the perfect candidate to achieve ~1000m. Its short (3.5s) burn and moderate average thrust (658.7N) will ensure fast acceleration while allowing for stable flight trajectory despite wind.

We choose the **AeroTechK700W** motor.

### Step 2: Rocket Dimensions & Materials

- **Motor Diameter** = 54mm → body radius at least 0.03m (30mm). Let's select a safe clearance and ease manufacture with a radius of **0.04m (80 mm diameter)**.
- Typical aspect ratio (length to diameter) around 10-15 provides good aerodynamic stability — we'll choose about 10 times body diameter. Body Diameter = 0.08 m → Body Length ~ 0.8 m
- Selecting the **fiberglass** as body material provides superior strength/weight balance at reasonable cost and ease of manufacturing. Thickness for structural integrity: approximately 0.003m (3mm).

Thus the body tube:
- Radius: 0.04 m (80 mm diameter)
- Length: 0.8 m
- Material: fiberglass (strong yet cost-effective)
- Thickness: 0.003 m (strong yet reasonably lightweight)

### Step 3: Nose Cone

- Optimal nose shape for subsonic flight (under Mach 1) is usually **ogive or von Karman**. We'll select **ogive** shape for simplicity, good aerodynamic profile, and ease of manufacturing.
- Typical nose cone length: Approximately 3-4x body diameter (~0.24–0.32m). Select length 0.25 m length (reasonable aerodynamic balance).
- Material choice: lightweight & sturdy composite to reduce overall rocket mass and cost effectively manages aerodynamic loads.

Thus nose cone:
- Shape: ogive
- Length: 0.25 m
- Material: composite

### Step 4: Fin Design

In the presence of moderate wind (5 m/s from East), larger size fins are essential for stability during launch and recovery:

- Fin Number: 4 fins provide ideal stability, redundancy, and ease of alignment.
- Root Chord: around 0.12m (120mm), reasonable length for firm structural attachment.
- Tip Chord: around half root chord: ~0.06 m.
- Span: around 0.1 m span for solid aerodynamic stabilization without excessive drag.
- Cant Angle: a slight cant angle of 1 degrees can assist centering and stability without undue rotation.
- Choose **carbon_fiber** construction material for high stiffness-to-weight ratio, excellent strength, and minimal thickness/mass addition.
- Thickness Fin: 0.003 m (3mm) structurally sound and low drag.

Thus fins:
- Number: 4
- Root chord: 0.12 m
- Tip chord: 0.06 m
- Span: 0.1 m
- Cant Angle: 1 degree
- Material: carbon_fiber
- Thickness: 0.003 m

### Step 5: Tail Dimensions

- Tail length: Slightly larger for aerodynamic smoothness: 0.08 m
- Top radius slightly tapered from tail coupling: 0.035 m
- Bottom radius matches rocket's main body radius: 0.04 m
- Material: fiberglass matches rocket main body.

Thus tail:
- Length: 0.08 m
- Top radius: 0.035 m
- Bottom radius: 0.04 m  
- Material: fiberglass

### Step 6: Parachute Specifications

For safe landing (<5 m/s impact speed):

Approximate mass loaded rocket: 
- Empty rocket structural mass estimate (body tube, fins, nose, payload) ~3 kg 
- Motor Dry mass (~0.732 kg) + propellant mass ~ (2249Ns)/(177.5 s *9.81)= 1.29 kg approx.
- Payload~ 0.5 kg
➡️ Total mass ~ 3 + 0.732 + 1.29 + 0.5 ≈ 5.5 kg

A typical main parachute for soft landing:
- Use typical descent rate equation: V ≈ sqrt((2 × m × g)/(ρ × Cd × A)), aiming for below 5 m/s descent, approx required effective area ~ about 1.2 m² (cd_s),
- Drogue chute: smaller effective area about 0.2 m² stabilized early descent.

Main parachute: cd_s~1.2 m²  
Drogue parachute: cd_s~0.2 m²

### Step 7: Launch Configuration

- Rail length: sufficient for stable initial velocity (>8m/s recommended at leave rail). Using a standard length of 3.0 m rail.
- Inclination adjusted very slightly (88 deg) to counteract eastward wind and reach desired landing position southwest at (3000.0m, 5000.0m), heading=45 degrees NE (0 would be north), so heading chosen 45 degrees to counterbalance drift from Eastern wind.

Launch:
- Rail length: 3 m
- Inclination: 88 degrees
- Heading: 45 degrees (to counter east wind drift towards target at (3000.0m,5000.0m))

### Payload:
- Mass: 0.5 kg payload specified.
- Position: Near rocket center (+0.4 m center-forward from rocket midpoint) ensures stability.
