# Design Justification & Engineering Reasoning

### Step 1: Motor Selection

The target apogee is 1000 meters, placing it clearly within the mid-power range. Let's evaluate the available motors:

- **Pro75M1670, CesaroniM1670, CesaroniO3700, O5800** are far too powerful and will greatly overshoot a 1 km apogee.
- **AeroTechH128W** has too low impulse (~176 Ns), likely too small for achieving the target altitude given structural mass and drag.
- **CesaroniK160** (~1521 Ns), is moderate, providing steady thrust over a 9.7s burn, but could fall slightly short of reaching 1 km apogee.
- **AeroTechK700W** (~2249 Ns) provides a good compromise of thrust and impulse and could be the perfect candidate to achieve ~1000m. Its short (3.5s) burn and moderate average thrust (658.7N) will ensure fast acceleration while allowing for stable flight trajectory despite wind.

We choose the **AeroTechK700W** motor.

### Step 2: Rocket Dimensions & Materials

- **Motor Diameter** = 54mm → body radius at least 0.03m (30mm). Let's select a safe clearance and ease manufacture with a radius of **0.04m (80 mm diameter)**.
- Typical aspect ratio (length to diameter) around 10-15 provides good aerodynamic stability — we'll choose about 10 times body diameter. Body Diameter = 0.08 m → Body Length ~ 0.8 m
- Selecting the **fiberglass** as body material provides superior strength/weight balance at reasonable cost and ease of manufacturing. Thickness for structural integrity: approximately 0.003m (3mm).

Thus the body tube:
- Radius: 0.04 m (80 mm diameter)
- Length: 0.8 m
- Material: fiberglass (strong yet cost-effective)
- Thickness: 0.003 m (strong yet reasonably lightweight)

### Step 3: Nose Cone

- Optimal nose shape for subsonic flight (under Mach 1) is usually **ogive or von Karman**. We'll select **ogive** shape for simplicity, good aerodynamic profile, and ease of manufacturing.
- Typical nose cone length: Approximately 3-4x body diameter (~0.24–0.32m). Select length 0.25 m length (reasonable aerodynamic balance).
- Material choice: lightweight & sturdy composite to reduce overall rocket mass and cost effectively manages aerodynamic loads.

Thus nose cone:
- Shape: ogive
- Length: 0.25 m
- Material: composite

### Step 4: Fin Design

In the presence of moderate wind (5 m/s from East), larger size fins are essential for stability during launch and recovery:

- Fin Number: 4 fins provide ideal stability, redundancy, and ease of alignment.
- Root Chord: around 0.12m (120mm), reasonable length for firm structural attachment.
- Tip Chord: around half root chord: ~0.06 m.
- Span: around 0.1 m span for solid aerodynamic stabilization without excessive drag.
- Cant Angle: a slight cant angle of 1 degrees can assist centering and stability without undue rotation.
- Choose **carbon_fiber** construction material for high stiffness-to-weight ratio, excellent strength, and minimal thickness/mass addition.
- Thickness Fin: 0.003 m (3mm) structurally sound and low drag.

Thus fins:
- Number: 4
- Root chord: 0.12 m
- Tip chord: 0.06 m
- Span: 0.1 m
- Cant Angle: 1 degree
- Material: carbon_fiber
- Thickness: 0.003 m

### Step 5: Tail Dimensions

- Tail length: Slightly larger for aerodynamic smoothness: 0.08 m
- Top radius slightly tapered from tail coupling: 0.035 m
- Bottom radius matches rocket's main body radius: 0.04 m
- Material: fiberglass matches rocket main body.

Thus tail:
- Length: 0.08 m
- Top radius: 0.035 m
- Bottom radius: 0.04 m  
- Material: fiberglass

### Step 6: Parachute Specifications

For safe landing (<5 m/s impact speed):

Approximate mass loaded rocket: 
- Empty rocket structural mass estimate (body tube, fins, nose, payload) ~3 kg 
- Motor Dry mass (~0.732 kg) + propellant mass ~ (2249Ns)/(177.5 s *9.81)= 1.29 kg approx.
- Payload~ 0.5 kg
➡️ Total mass ~ 3 + 0.732 + 1.29 + 0.5 ≈ 5.5 kg

A typical main parachute for soft landing:
- Use typical descent rate equation: V ≈ sqrt((2 × m × g)/(ρ × Cd × A)), aiming for below 5 m/s descent, approx required effective area ~ about 1.2 m² (cd_s),
- Drogue chute: smaller effective area about 0.2 m² stabilized early descent.

Main parachute: cd_s~1.2 m²  
Drogue parachute: cd_s~0.2 m²

### Step 7: Launch Configuration

- Rail length: sufficient for stable initial velocity (>8m/s recommended at leave rail). Using a standard length of 3.0 m rail.
- Inclination adjusted very slightly (88 deg) to counteract eastward wind and reach desired landing position southwest at (3000.0m, 5000.0m), heading=45 degrees NE (0 would be north), so heading chosen 45 degrees to counterbalance drift from Eastern wind.

Launch:
- Rail length: 3 m
- Inclination: 88 degrees
- Heading: 45 degrees (to counter east wind drift towards target at (3000.0m,5000.0m))

### Payload:
- Mass: 0.5 kg payload specified.
- Position: Near rocket center (+0.4 m center-forward from rocket midpoint) ensures stability.
