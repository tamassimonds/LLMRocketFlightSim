**Analysis:**

- **Target Velocity Calculation:**
  
  Using the basic kinematic equation (neglecting air resistance):
  
  \[
  V = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 3048} \approx 244 \, \text{m/s}
  \]
  
- **Total Impulse Requirement:**
  
  Total impulse (\( I \)) is the product of mass (\( m \)) and velocity (\( V \)):
  
  \[
  I = m \times V
  \]
  
  To determine an appropriate motor, we need to estimate the rocket's total mass.

- **Mass Estimation:**
  
  A balance between motor thrust, structural materials, payload, and parachutes must be achieved. An estimated mass of **5 kg** is reasonable for achieving the desired apogee without excessive structural weight.

  \[
  I = 5 \times 244 = 1220 \, \text{Ns}
  \]
  
- **Motor Selection:**
  
  Among the available motors, the **CesaroniK160** offers a total impulse of **1521.7 Ns**, which provides a sufficient safety margin above the estimated requirement of **1220 Ns**. It also has a favorable burn time of **9.7 seconds**, allowing for stable thrust application.

**Selected Motor:** **CesaroniK160**

#### **2. Rocket Body Design**

**Specifications:**

- **Motor Radius:** 54 mm (0.054 m)
- **Body Radius:** Must exceed the motor radius. **0.06 m (60 mm)** is selected to accommodate the motor and internal components.
- **Body Length:** **1.2 meters** to provide ample space for the motor, payload, and structural elements.
- **Material:** **Fiberglass** is chosen for its balance between strength, weight, and cost.
- **Wall Thickness:** **0.003 meters (3 mm)** to ensure structural integrity while keeping mass low.

**Calculations:**

- **Volume Calculation (Cylindrical Shell):**
  
  \[
  \text{Volume} = 2 \times \pi \times r \times t \times L = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.06 \times 0.003 \times 1.2 \approx 0.00136 \, \text{m}^3
  \]
  
- **Mass Calculation:**
  
  Assuming fiberglass density of **1850 kg/m³**:
  
  \[
  \text{Mass} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 0.00136 \times 1850 \approx 2.52 \, \text{kg}
  \]
  
**Rationale:**

- **Fiberglass** offers a lightweight yet strong structure, essential for maintaining the rocket's integrity during ascent and descent.
- **Wall Thickness** of **3 mm** provides a robust shell without adding unnecessary weight.

- **Length:** **0.3 meters** to streamline airflow and reduce drag.
- **Material:** **Composite** to match the body material, ensuring structural consistency.

**Calculations:**

- **Volume Calculation (Ogive Nose Cone):**
  
  Approximating the ogive as a streamlined surface, the mass contribution is minimal compared to the body. Assume a mass of **0.5 kg** for the nose cone.

**Rationale:**

- An **ogive** nose cone minimizes aerodynamic drag, contributing to a higher apogee and stability during flight.
- Using **composite** ensures that the nose cone maintains structural integrity while keeping the mass low.

---

#### **4. Fin Design**

**Specifications:**

- **Material:** **Balsa Wood** for its lightweight properties and ease of manufacturing.
- **Thickness:** **0.005 meters (5 mm)** to ensure strength without adding unnecessary weight.

**Calculations:**

- **Volume per Fin:**
  
  Approximate each fin as a trapezoidal prism.
  
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{( \text{Root Chord} + \text{Tip Chord} )}{2} \times \text{Span} = \frac{0.15 + 0.075}{2} \times 0.3 = 0.03375 \, \text{m}^2
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Volume} = \text{Area} \times \text{Thickness} = 0.03375 \times 0.005 = 0.00016875 \, \text{m}^3
  \]
  
- **Mass per Fin:**
  
  Assuming balsa wood density of **1600 kg/m³**:
  
  \[
  \text{Mass} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 0.00016875 \times 1600 \approx 0.27 \, \text{kg}
  \]
  
- **Total Fin Mass:**
  
  \[
  4 \times 0.27 = 1.08 \, \text{kg}
  \]
  
**Rationale:**

- **Four fins** provide adequate stability without introducing excessive drag.
- **Balsa Wood** ensures the fins are lightweight yet strong enough to maintain structural integrity during flight.

#### **5. Tail Design**

**Specifications:**

- **Length:** **0.2 meters**
- **Top Radius:** **0.04 meters**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.045 meters** (different from top radius to comply with design constraints)
- **Material:** **Carbon Fiber** for enhanced strength and lightweight properties.

**Calculations:**

- **Volume Calculation (Tapered Tail Cylinder):**
  
  \[
  \text{Volume} = \pi \times \frac{(R_{\text{top}}^2 + R_{\text{bottom}}^2)}{2} \times L = 3.1416 \times \frac{0.04^2 + 0.045^2}{2} \times 0.2 \approx 0.00272 \, \text{m}^3
  \]
  
- **Mass Calculation:**
  
  Assuming carbon fiber density of **1600 kg/m³**:
  
  \[
  \text{Mass} = 0.00272 \times 1600 \approx 4.35 \, \text{kg}
  \]
  
  **Note:** This mass seems high; to optimize, reduce the wall thickness.
  
  - **Wall Thickness:** **0.002 meters (2 mm)**
  
  \[
  \text{Volume} = 2 \times \pi \times r \times t \times L = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.04 \times 0.002 \times 0.2 \approx 0.0001005 \, \text{m}^3
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Mass} = 0.0001005 \times 1600 \approx 0.161 \, \text{kg}
  \]
  
**Rationale:**

- The **tapered tail** enhances aerodynamic stability, reducing potential oscillations during flight.
- **Carbon Fiber** ensures the tail is robust yet lightweight, maintaining overall rocket efficiency.
