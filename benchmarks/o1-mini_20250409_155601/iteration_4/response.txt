**Calculation & Analysis:**

To determine the appropriate motor, we need to estimate the required total impulse (\( I \)) based on the desired apogee.

1. **Apogee and Required Velocity:**
   
   Using the kinematic equation (neglecting air resistance and assuming vertical ascent):
   
   \[
   V = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 3048} \approx 244 \, \text{m/s}
   \]
   
2. **Total Impulse Calculation:**
   
   Total impulse (\( I \)) is the product of mass (\( m \)) and velocity (\( V \)):
   
   \[
   I = m \times V
   \]
   
   However, considering real-world inefficiencies such as air resistance, structural weight, and propulsion losses, it's prudent to include a safety margin. A common practice is to aim for a total impulse that is **2-3 times** the minimum requirement.
   
3. **Estimating Rocket Mass (\( m \)):**
   
   To minimize mass while ensuring structural integrity, an estimated rocket mass of **3 kg** is targeted. This includes the motor, structure, payload, fins, nose cone, tail, and parachutes.
   
   \[
   I = 3 \times 244 = 732 \, \text{Ns}
   \]
   
   Adding a safety margin (×3):
   
   \[
   I_{\text{required}} = 732 \times 3 = 2196 \, \text{Ns}
   \]
   
4. **Motor Selection:**
   
   Reviewing the available motors:
   
   - **CesaroniK160:** 1521.7 Ns
   - **AeroTechK700W:** 2249 Ns
   - **Pro75M1670 / CesaroniM1670:** 6023.6 Ns
   - **CesaroniO3700:** 29930.2 Ns
   - **CesaroniO5800:** 30382.7 Ns
   
   - **Decision:** The **AeroTechK700W** motor provides **2249 Ns**, which slightly exceeds the required **2196 Ns**. This motor offers a balance between sufficient thrust and manageable rocket mass, making it an optimal choice.
   
   **Selected Motor:** **AeroTechK700W**

   \]
   
2. **Mass Calculation:**
   
   Assuming carbon fiber density of **1600 kg/m³**:
   
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 0.0008796 \times 1600 \approx 1.407 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   
3. **Optimization:**
   
   - **Reducing Length:** A **1.0-meter** body reduces mass compared to longer designs.
   - **Thickness:** Maintaining a **2 mm** thickness ensures structural integrity while keeping mass low.

**Rationale:**

Using **carbon fiber** provides a lightweight and strong structure, essential for maintaining the rocket's integrity during ascent and descent. The selected dimensions balance the need for internal space and minimal mass.

- **Thickness:** **0.004 meters (4 mm)** to ensure strength without adding unnecessary weight.

**Calculations:**

1. **Volume per Fin:**
   
   Approximating each fin as a trapezoidal prism:
   
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{(\text{Root Chord} + \text{Tip Chord})}{2} \times \text{Span} = \frac{0.12 + 0.06}{2} \times 0.25 = 0.0225 \, \text{m}^2
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Area} \times \text{Thickness} = 0.0225 \times 0.004 = 0.00009 \, \text{m}^3
   \]
   
2. **Mass per Fin:**
   
   Assuming balsa wood density of **1600 kg/m³**:
   
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 0.00009 \times 1600 = 0.144 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   
3. **Total Fin Mass:**
   
   \[
   4 \times 0.144 = 0.576 \, \text{kg}

   \[
   \text{Volume} = 2 \times \pi \times r \times t \times L = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.03 \times 0.002 \times 0.15 \approx 0.0000565 \, \text{m}^3
   \]
   
2. **Mass Calculation:**
   
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 0.0000565 \times 1600 \approx 0.0904 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   
**Rationale:**

The tapered tail enhances aerodynamic stability, reducing potential oscillations during flight. **Carbon fiber** ensures the tail is robust yet lightweight, maintaining overall rocket efficiency.
