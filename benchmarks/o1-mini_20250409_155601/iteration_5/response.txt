   \]

   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Area} \times \text{Thickness} = 0.027 \times 0.004 = 0.000108 \, \text{m}^3
   \]

2. **Mass per Fin:**

   Assuming balsa wood density of **1600 kg/m³**:

   \[
   \text{Mass} = 0.000108 \times 1600 = 0.1728 \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Total Fin Mass:**

   \[

   \]

2. **Mass Calculation:**

   \[
   \text{Mass} = 0.000098 \times 1600 \approx 0.157 \, \text{kg}
