**Calculation & Analysis:**

To achieve an apogee of 3048 meters, a preliminary estimation of the required velocity (\( V \)) can be derived using the kinematic equation:

\[
V = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 3048} \approx 244 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Assuming a **total mass (\( m \))** of **1 kg** (including motor, structure, payload, and parachutes), the **total impulse (\( I \))** required is:

\[
I = m \times V + m \times g \times t_{\text{burn}}
\]

Where \( t_{\text{burn}} \) is the motor's burn time.

For the **CesaroniK160**:
- **Total Impulse (I):** 1521.7 Ns
- **Burn Time (t):** 9.7 s

\[
I = 1 \times 244 + 1 \times 9.81 \times 9.7 \approx 244 + 95.3 \approx 339.3 \, \text{Ns}
\]

**Conclusion:** The **CesaroniK160** motor provides **1521.7 Ns**, which comfortably exceeds the required **339.3 Ns**, offering a substantial safety margin. Additionally, it has a favorable burn time and thrust profile suitable for achieving the desired apogee without unnecessary excess, ensuring cost-effectiveness.

**Selected Motor:** **CesaroniK160**

  \]
  
- **Mass Estimation:**
  
  Carbon fiber typically has a density of around 1600 kg/m³.
  
  \[
  \text{Mass} = 1600 \times 0.0113 \approx 18.08 \, \text{kg}
  \]
  
  **Optimization:** To minimize mass while maintaining structural integrity:

  Recalculating mass:
  
  \[
  \text{Volume} = 2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \times \text{thickness} \times \text{length} = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.06 \times 0.002 \times 1.0 \approx 0.00075 \, \text{m}^3
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Mass} = 1600 \times 0.00075 \approx 1.2 \, \text{kg}
