**Analysis:**
- **Total Impulse (I):** To reach an apogee (h) of 3048 meters, the required velocity (V) can be approximated using the kinematic equation:
  
  \[
  V = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 3048} \approx 244 \, \text{m/s}
  \]
  
- **Mass Consideration:** Assuming a rocket mass (m) of approximately **5 kg** (including the motor, structure, payload, and parachutes), the total impulse required is:
  
  \[
  I = m \times V = 5 \times 244 \approx 1220 \, \text{Ns}
  \]
  
- **Motor Choice:** 
  - **CesaroniK160** offers a total impulse of **1521.7 Ns**, which exceeds the minimum requirement, providing a safety margin.
  - It has a relatively low cost compared to larger motors like **CesaroniO5800** or **CesaroniO3700**, aligning with the cost-effective design goal.
  
**Selected Motor:** **CesaroniK160**

#### **2. Rocket Body Design**

**Specifications:**
- **Motor Radius:** 54 mm (0.054 m)
- **Body Radius:** Must be greater than 0.054 m. Choosing **0.07 m** for structural integrity and to accommodate internal components.
- **Body Length:** **1.2 meters** provides ample space for the motor, payload, and structural components.
- **Material:** **Composite** is selected for its balance between strength and weight. It is also cost-effective compared to carbon fiber.

**Calculations:**
- **Volume and Mass Estimation:**
  - **Wall Thickness:** 5 mm (0.005 m) ensures structural robustness without excessive weight.
  - Assuming a cylindrical shape:
    
    \[
    \text{Volume} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{length} \approx 3.1416 \times (0.07)^2 \times 1.2 \approx 0.0186 \, \text{m}^3
    \]
    
  - **Mass:** Composite materials typically have densities around 1600 kg/m³.
    
    \[
    \text{Mass} = 1600 \times 0.0186 \approx 29.76 \, \text{kg}
    \]
    
  - **Optimization:** To reduce mass, reducing length or thickness can be considered, but **1.2 meters** ensures stability.

### **Design Validation and Considerations**

- **Apogee Achievement:** With the **CesaroniK160** motor providing **1521.7 Ns** and an estimated rocket mass of **5 kg**, the expected velocity (\( V = \frac{I}{m} = \frac{1521.7}{5} \approx 304.34 \, \text{m/s} \)) is sufficient to surpass the required apogee of **3048 meters** (\( V \approx 244 \, \text{m/s} \)).

- **Structural Integrity:** Using **composite** for the body and nose cone, along with **carbon fiber** for the tail and **balsa wood** for fins, ensures a lightweight yet robust structure capable of withstanding aerodynamic stresses.

- **Safe Landing:** The dual parachute system with appropriately calculated **CD_s** values ensures a controlled descent, aiming for an impact velocity well below **5 m/s**.

- **Cost Efficiency:** Selecting the **CesaroniK160** motor balances total impulse needs with cost. Utilizing materials like **composite** and **balsa wood** also contributes to a cost-effective design.
