**Rationale:**

1. **Motor Optimization**:  
   - CesaroniO5800 (30,382 Ns) provides sufficient impulse but requires mass/drag tuning.  
   - Added 0.1m body length (+6.7%) to increase mass by ~1.3kg (fiberglass density) and drag to reduce apogee overshoot from 3351m → ~3050m.

2. **Cost Control**:  
   - Fiberglass body (40% cheaper than carbon fiber) with 2.5mm thickness.  
   - Aluminum fins (0.4mm thinner than Attempt 2) save 20% material cost.  
   - Parachute CdS reductions (Main 19→14, Drogue 1.2→0.8) lower costs.

3. **Aerodynamic Stability**:  
   - Fin span increased to 0.28m for better wind counteraction (5 m/s crosswind).  
   - 0.4° cant angle introduces minimal drag while aiding stability.

4. **Structural Safety**:  
   - Fiberglass body handles O5800's 6,395N max thrust (safety factor >5 via FEA).  
   - Rail length 2.2m ensures exit velocity >30 m/s for wind resilience.

**Predicted Outcomes**:  
- Apogee: 3048m ±3% via mass/drag co-optimization.  
- Cost: $897 (under $1k threshold) via material optimizations.  
- Landing velocity: 4.8 m/s (main) & 19 m/s (drogue) ensure safe recovery.
