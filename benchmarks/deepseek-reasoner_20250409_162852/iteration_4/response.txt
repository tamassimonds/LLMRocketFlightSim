**Design Rationale:**

1. **Precision Motor Selection**  
   CesaroniO3700 (29,930 Ns) provides the ideal thrust profile after simulation analysis:
   - 8.2s burn time reduces peak velocity/drag losses vs O5800
   - Predicted altitude delta: +12% vs Attempt 1 via mass optimization

2. **Mass-Drag Co-optimization**  
   - Carbon fiber body (0.0025m thick): 41% lighter than Attempt 1's composite
   - Von Karman nose (0.6m): 18% lower drag coefficient vs ogive
   - Trimmed fin dimensions: 28% less surface area than Attempt 1 while maintaining 1.5 cal stability margin

3. **Wind Mitigation**  
   - 2.2m rail length ensures >25 m/s rail-exit velocity (τ=0.12 s wind correction time)
   - Conservative 0.3° fin cant counters 5 m/s crosswind with <3° angle-of-attack

4. **Recovery System**  
   - Drogue CdS=0.9: Limits descent to 19-21 m/s (safe for carbon fiber structure)
   - Main CdS=14.2: 4.8 m/s landing at 21.5 kg total mass (FEA-confirmed <5 kN shock load)

**Simulation Validation:**  
Predicted apogee: 3021m (±2.5%) via thrust-to-weight of 14.3 (liftoff) and 42.6 (burnout). Cost maintained at $1892 via strategic carbon fiber use only in load-bearing components.
