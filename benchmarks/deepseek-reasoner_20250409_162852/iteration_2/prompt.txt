# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

Before answering you should provide your full reasoning for the design choices you made thinking like a rocket scientist. Run sample calulations, make approximations etc to find best design

**Design Rationale:**

1. **Motor Selection**  
Selected CesaroniO3700 for its high total impulse (29,930 Ns) and moderate burn time (8.2s). This balances thrust-to-weight ratio (~5.5) and minimizes drag losses compared to shorter-burn motors. The O5800 was rejected due to excessive predicted altitude overshoot.

2. **Body Design**  
- Radius 0.165m accommodates the motor (161mm) with margin.  
- Composite material balances strength and cost.  
- Length 1.5m ensures motor fit and structural stability.  
- Thickness 3mm reduces weight while maintaining integrity.

3. **Nose Cone**  
- Ogive shape minimizes drag.  
- 0.5m length (3x body radius) optimizes aerodynamics.  
- Composite material for lightweight durability.

4. **Fins**  
- 4 trapezoidal fins for stability.  
- Carbon fiber for high strength-to-weight ratio.  
- Small cant angle (0.5°) mitigates spin while minimizing drag.

5. **Parachutes**  
- Drogue (CdS=2.2) stabilizes descent at ~20 m/s.  
- Main (CdS=25) ensures safe landing <5 m/s.  
- Both triggered at apogee for simplicity.

6. **Launch Rail**  
- 2.0m rail ensures stable initial flight.  
- Vertical launch (90°) minimizes wind drift.

**Tradeoffs:**  
- Composite materials increase cost slightly but reduce mass for better altitude control.  
- O3700's longer burn time reduces peak velocity, mitigating drag losses.  
- Conservative parachute sizing ensures safe landing despite uncertainties in mass/drag.
