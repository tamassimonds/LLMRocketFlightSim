**Design Rationale:**

1. **Motor Upgrade**: Switched to CesaroniO5800 (30,382 Ns impulse) for 4.5% more total impulse than O3700 while being 1.8 kg lighter. Burn time of 5.2s balances thrust and drag losses.

2. **Mass Optimization**:
   - Body radius reduced to 0.155m (from 0.165) to minimize drag while accommodating motor.
   - Aluminum body (3mm thick) cuts cost while maintaining strength (T/W ratio 17.5 at liftoff).

3. **Aerodynamic Refinement**:
   - Shorter 0.45m ogive nose cone maintains low drag with reduced mass.
   - Aluminum fins provide stability at lower cost than carbon fiber.

4. **Parachute Sizing**:
   - Main chute CdS=19 ensures <5 m/s landing (vs 25 in previous attempt) for cost reduction.
   - Drogue CdS=1.2 limits descent to 20 m/s during initial phase.

5. **Structural Safety**:
   - Aluminum fins (5mm thick) handle 6,395N max thrust.
   - Rail length maintained at 2.0m for stability in 5 m/s crosswind.

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Increased apogee to ~3,000m via higher impulse and reduced mass.
- Cost reduced below $1,000 threshold via material substitutions.
- Structural safety maintained with aluminum/fiberglass components.
