**Design Rationale:**

1. **Motor Selection**  
Selected CesaroniO3700 for its high total impulse (29,930 Ns) and moderate burn time (8.2s). This balances thrust-to-weight ratio (~5.5) and minimizes drag losses compared to shorter-burn motors. The O5800 was rejected due to excessive predicted altitude overshoot.

2. **Body Design**  
- Radius 0.165m accommodates the motor (161mm) with margin.  
- Composite material balances strength and cost.  
- Length 1.5m ensures motor fit and structural stability.  
- Thickness 3mm reduces weight while maintaining integrity.

3. **Nose Cone**  
- Ogive shape minimizes drag.  
- 0.5m length (3x body radius) optimizes aerodynamics.  
- Composite material for lightweight durability.

4. **Fins**  
- 4 trapezoidal fins for stability.  
- Carbon fiber for high strength-to-weight ratio.  
- Small cant angle (0.5°) mitigates spin while minimizing drag.

5. **Parachutes**  
- Drogue (CdS=2.2) stabilizes descent at ~20 m/s.  
- Main (CdS=25) ensures safe landing <5 m/s.  
- Both triggered at apogee for simplicity.

6. **Launch Rail**  
- 2.0m rail ensures stable initial flight.  
- Vertical launch (90°) minimizes wind drift.

**Tradeoffs:**  
- Composite materials increase cost slightly but reduce mass for better altitude control.  
- O3700's longer burn time reduces peak velocity, mitigating drag losses.  
- Conservative parachute sizing ensures safe landing despite uncertainties in mass/drag.
