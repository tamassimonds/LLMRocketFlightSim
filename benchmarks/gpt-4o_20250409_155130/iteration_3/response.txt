To improve the previous designs and address the deficiencies, particularly in achieving the target apogee and ensuring structural integrity, we need to reevaluate our choices regarding the motor, materials, and design parameters. Here's a refined approach:

### Key Considerations

1. **Target Apogee**: The rocket must achieve around 3048 meters. Previous attempts fell short, so we may need a motor with higher impulse.

2. **Cost Efficiency**: Balancing material and motor cost is crucial. We'll aim for cheaper yet strong materials without compromising integrity.

3. **Structural Integrity**: Choose materials that withstand aerodynamic forces. This includes ensuring proper bonding and construction techniques.

4. **Landing Safety**: Consider the parachute specifications to ensure impact velocity is below 5 m/s.

5. **Minimize Drift**: Adjust launch heading to minimize drift caused by the wind.

### Revised Design Decisions

**Motor Choice:**
- **Motor Selected**: CesaroniM1670 (more impulse than the previous AeroTechK700W).

**Rocket Body:**
- **Radius**: Must be greater than the motor's radius. Opt for 0.08m, providing a snug but secure fit.
- **Material**: Composite for a light yet robust structure.
- **Length**: 1.3m to ensure aerodynamics and stability.
- **Thickness**: 0.003m to maintain structural integrity without excessive weight.

**Nose Cone:**
- **Type**: Von Karman - excellent aerodynamic efficiency.
- **Length**: 0.35m for streamlined airflow.
- **Material**: Carbon fiber, balancing weight and durability.

**Fins:**
- **Number of Fins**: 4 for optimal stability.
- **Root Chord**: 0.18m.
- **Tip Chord**: 0.09m.
- **Span**: 0.22m for adequate control.
- **Cant Angle**: 0° to avoid unnecessary drag.
- **Material**: Fiberglass – lightweight and sufficient strength.
- **Thickness**: 0.004m.

**Tail:**
- **Length**: 0.12m.
- **Top Radius**: 0.07m.
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.075m.
- **Material**: ABS Plastic for cost-effectiveness.

**Parachutes:**
- **Main CD_s**: 0.75 for safe descent speed.
- **Drogue CD_s**: 0.3 for stabilization.

**Launch Configuration:**
- **Rail Length**: 2.0m to provide a stable initial trajectory.
- **Inclination**: 90° for maximum vertical lift.
- **Heading**: Adjust toward 270° to compensate eastward wind drift.

**Payload:**
- **Mass**: 0.4 kg to optimize weight while achieving desired performance.
- **Position**: 0.65m to ensure proper center of gravity.

Here is the revised configuration:
