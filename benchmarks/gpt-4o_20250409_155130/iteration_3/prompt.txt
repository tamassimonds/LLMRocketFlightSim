# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

Before answering you should provide your full reasoning for the design choices you made thinking like a rocket scientist. Run sample calulations, make approximations etc to find best design



=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
To design a rocket that meets the given requirements, we should first analyze the components we have at our disposal and the objectives we need to meet. Let's break down the design considerations step by step:

### Objectives
1. Achieve a target apogee of 3048.0 meters.
2. Minimize costs to increase the cost reward.
3. Ensure safe landing with an impact speed below 5 m/s.
4. Ensure that the rocket remains structurally intact (no breaking).
5. Minimize horizontal drift due to wind (5 m/s from E direction).

### Materials & Motor Selection
#### Materials:
- Selection based on cost, weight, and strength.
- Lighter materials generally mean a higher apogee due to reduced overall mass.
- Potential choices: lightweight options like fiberglass, carbon fiber (though expensive), and balsa wood (for non-structural parts).

#### Motors:
- Analyze the available motors based on impulse and thrust.
- We need a motor with enough thrust to overcome gravity and achieve the target apogee but not too much to overshoot.
- Given the data and considering efficiency, the AeroTech K700W seems like a balanced choice with moderate thrust and a high Isp, good for a mid-sized budget option.

### Design Process
**Motor Choice:**  
Based on thrust requirements and cost balancing:
- **Motor Selected:** AeroTech K700W

**Rocket Body:**
- **Radius:** Needs to be larger than the motor radius of 0.054m (54mm).
- **Material:** Fiberglass, due to its lightweight and relatively low cost.
- **Length:** Sufficient to house the motor and payload, around 1.2 meters.
- **Thickness:** Keeping it thin to minimize weight, around 0.003m.

**Nose Cone:**
- **Type:** Tangent â€“ offers a good balance between drag reduction and simplicity.
- **Length:** About 0.3 meters which is a common proportion to the body length.
- **Material:** Composite for a balance of weight and strength.

**Fins:**
- To ensure good stability and control during flight:
- **Number of Fins:** 4
- **Root Chord:** 0.15 meters
- **Tip Chord:** 0.075 meters
- **Span:** 0.2 meters
- **Cant Angle:** 0 to optimize straight flight.
- **Material:** ABS Plastic to reduce cost.
- **Thickness:** 0.005 meters to ensure structural stability.

**Tail:**
- **Length:** 0.1 meters
- **Top Radius:** 0.055 meters (slightly larger than the motor radius)
- **Bottom Radius:** 0.06 meters
- **Material:** Plywood due to cost considerations.

**Parachute:**
- Two parachutes (main and drogue) for safe recovery:
- **Main CD_s:** 0.8 (for a slower descent)
- **Drogue CD_s:** 0.3 (for stability without rapid deceleration)

**Launch Settings:**
- **Rail Length:** 1.5 meters to ensure enough velocity off the rail.
- **Inclination:** 90 degrees for maximum altitude.
- **Heading:** Adjusted considering wind from E, setting to 270 degrees.

**Payload:**
- Small payload to balance total mass and achieve desired altitude.
- **Mass:** 0.5 kg
- **Position:** 0.6 meters from the nose cone.

Now, based on these considerations, here's the final configuration:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "AeroTechK700W",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.07,  # Body radius in meters
        "length": 1.2,   # Body length in meters

            "material": "plywood",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",

            "trigger": "apogee",

            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.5,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 90,   # Rail inclination in degrees (vertical)
        "heading": 270,      # Launch heading in degrees (compensating for wind)
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.5,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.6  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This configuration is designed to meet the apogee target while considering cost and structural integrity, factoring in the likely horizontal drift due to the eastward wind, and ensuring safe landing with the parachute system.
Score: 0.00/100

--- ATTEMPT 2 ---
Design:
To address the shortcomings from the first attempt and improve the rocket design for better scores, we need to re-evaluate the decisions made on components and materials with a particular focus on lowering the cost, ensuring the structural integrity, minimizing the landing impact velocity, and achieving the target apogee more precisely. Let's go through each aspect to refine the design.

### Key Considerations

1. **Target Apogee**: We need a motor that can reliably reach close to 3048 meters. The previous choice with AeroTechK700W fell short because of its lower total impulse. Selecting a motor with a higher impulse can ensure reaching the target apogee.
   
2. **Cost**: We must be cautious about selecting the materials and motor to stay within a reasonable budget. We can reduce costs by opting for cheaper materials but need to ensure that structural integrity is maintained.

3. **Structural Integrity**: The rocket must withstand the aerodynamic forces, particularly due to wind. Using stronger materials where necessary is crucial.

4. **Landing Safety**: Ensuring a safe landing is paramount. This might require reconsidering parachute sizes and materials.

5. **Wind Drift**: Adjust orientation to minimize wind drift, as the wind will push the rocket westward.

### Revised Design Decisions

**Motor Choice:**
- **Motor Selected**: Pro75M1670 (higher impulse than AeroTechK700W).

**Rocket Body:**
- **Radius**: Needs to accommodate the new motor (75mm = 0.075m), so it's set to 0.08m.
- **Material**: Aluminum, which is slightly heavier but cheaper and still strong.
- **Length**: Extended to 1.5m for better aerodynamics.
- **Thickness**: 0.002m to strike a balance between weight and structural stability.

**Nose Cone:**
- **Type**: Von Karman â€“ provides excellent aerodynamic properties with minimal drag.
- **Length**: 0.4m, longer to reduce drag.
- **Material**: Fiberglass for reduced cost and weight.

**Fins:**
- **Number of Fins**: 4 for stability.
- **Root Chord**: 0.2m.
- **Tip Chord**: 0.1m.
- **Span**: 0.25m for better control.
- **Cant Angle**: 0.5Â° to aid with stability.
- **Material**: Carbon Fiber for lightweight and stiffness.
- **Thickness**: 0.004m.

**Tail:**
- **Length**: 0.15m.
- **Top Radius**: 0.08m.
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.075m.
- **Material**: Plywood, inexpensive yet functional.

**Parachutes:**
- **Main CD_s**: 1.0 for effective slow descent.
- **Drogue CD_s**: 0.5 for stabilization before main chute deployment.

**Launch Configuration:**
- **Rail Length**: 2.0m to ensure a stable launch trajectory.
- **Inclination**: 88Â° to slightly counteract wind effects.
- **Heading**: 270Â°, directly against the wind.

**Payload:**
- **Mass**: 0.3 kg to reduce weight for better altitude.
- **Position**: 0.8m to ensure stable CG location.
