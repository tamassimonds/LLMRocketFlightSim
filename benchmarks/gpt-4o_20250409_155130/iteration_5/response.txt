To improve upon the previous attempts, we need to focus on achieving closer alignment with the target apogee, maintaining cost efficiency, and enhancing structural integrity. Let's analyze the key design elements:

### Key Observations from Previous Attempts:

1. **Achieving Target Apogee**: The motors used previously either fell short or overcompensated for the apogee requirement. We need to fine-tune motor selection and other contributing factors like drag and mass distribution.

2. **Cost Management**: The cost went beyond the target of $1000 in the latest attempt, indicating a need for more economical material selection while ensuring structural reliability.

3. **Structural Integrity**: The latest design passed structural integrity but increased costs significantly due to high-end materials like carbon fiber. We need a balanced choice of materials.

4. **Landing Safety**: Ensuring the rocket lands safely with a controlled parachute system to minimize impact velocity.

5. **Drift Minimization**: Setting the launch heading to compensate for the wind to reduce horizontal drift from the launch site.

### Revised Design Decisions:

**Motor Choice:**
- **Motor Selected**: AeroTechK700W. Using a more balanced motor with moderate impulse suitable to achieve the desired apogee without excessive cost.

**Rocket Body:**
- **Radius**: 0.09m (larger than the motor radius, considering structural stability).
- **Material**: Fiberglass offers a good balance between cost, lightness, and strength.
- **Length**: 1.8m for stability and to house the motor and payload.
- **Thickness**: 0.0025m to reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity.

**Nose Cone:**
- **Type**: Von Karman (consistent with aerodynamic efficiency goals).
- **Length**: 0.4m to streamline airflow.
- **Material**: Fiberglass for reduced weight and cost.

**Fins:**
- **Number of Fins**: 4 for optimal aerodynamic stability.
- **Root Chord**: 0.18m.
- **Tip Chord**: 0.1m.
- **Span**: 0.25m for enhanced control.
- **Cant Angle**: 0° for minimal drag.
- **Material**: Fiberglass, as it's lighter and cost-effective.
- **Thickness**: 0.003m to ensure durability during flight.

**Tail:**
- **Length**: 0.15m for better aerodynamic stability.
- **Top Radius**: 0.08m.
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.085m.
- **Material**: ABS Plastic for cost-efficiency and adequate strength.

**Parachutes:**
- **Main CD_s**: 1.0 for safe descent speed post-apogee.
- **Drogue CD_s**: 0.35 for stabilization before main chute deployment.

**Launch Configuration:**
- **Rail Length**: 2.0m for stable initial acceleration.
- **Inclination**: 89° to slightly reduce horizontal drift induced by wind.
- **Heading**: 270°, directly compensating for eastward wind.

**Payload:**
- **Mass**: 0.25 kg to balance overall mass while achieving target performance.
- **Position**: 0.85m to ensure proper center of gravity alignment.

### Rationale:

- **Motor**: The AeroTechK700W provides a sufficient impulse without overshooting, allowing for a lower-cost motor choice.
- **Materials**: Use of fiberglass throughout offers cost savings while maintaining necessary performance.
- **Aerodynamics**: Proper fin design and nose cone shape will improve flight stability and minimize drag.
- **Parachutes**: Enhanced CD_s for safety upon descent.
- **Cost**: By selecting affordable materials and optimizing design, cost targets remain achievable while maintaining structural soundness. 

This approach seeks a balanced performance that stays within cost limits, approaches the target apogee, and ensures safe recovery while maintaining structural integrity and minimizing drift.
