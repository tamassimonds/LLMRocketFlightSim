To improve on the previous attempts and achieve a higher score, we need to focus on improving the following areas:

1. **Achieve Target Apogee More Precisely**: Previous designs have consistently underperformed in achieving the target apogee, indicating a need for higher thrust or more aerodynamic efficiency.

2. **Cost Efficiency**: Staying below the max cost while balancing the weight and strength of materials is crucial to optimize the cost reward.

3. **Structural Integrity**: Ensure that the rocket can withstand the forces experienced during launch and flight.

4. **Landing Safety and Minimizing Drift**: With optimized parachute specifications, ensure the rocket lands safely and adjust launch configuration to reduce drift.

Let’s focus on refining the motor selection, material choices, and design parameters based on these observations.

### Key Design Adjustments

**Motor Choice:**
- **Motor Selected**: **CesaroniO3700** (higher impulse and efficient burn time suitable for achieving closer to the target apogee).

**Rocket Body:**
- **Radius**: 0.16m (accommodates the CesaroniO3700 motor and ensures stability).
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber** for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio.
- **Length**: 2.0m to provide ample space for the motor and maintain directional stability.
- **Thickness**: 0.002m to keep the structure light yet robust.

**Nose Cone:**
- **Type**: **Von Karman** (provides good aerodynamic efficiency).
- **Length**: 0.5m (to reduce drag and enhance lift).
- **Material**: **Fiberglass** for a balanced blend of weight and strength.

**Fins:**
- **Number of Fins**: 4 for stability.
- **Root Chord**: 0.25m to ensure stability throughout the flight.
- **Tip Chord**: 0.125m.
- **Span**: 0.3m for sufficient aerodynamic control.
- **Cant Angle**: 0° to minimize unnecessary drag.
- **Material**: **Composite** for lightweight and rigidity.
- **Thickness**: 0.003m to ensure fins withstand force.

**Tail:**
- **Length**: 0.2m to assist in exhaust and stability.
- **Top Radius**: 0.15m.
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.16m.
- **Material**: **ABS Plastic** for cost control with structural adequacy.

**Parachutes:**
- **Main CD_s**: 1.2 (larger area to ensure a slower descent).
- **Drogue CD_s**: 0.4 for controlled initial descent post-apogee.

**Launch Configuration:**
- **Rail Length**: 2.5m for better initial acceleration and stability.
- **Inclination**: 89° to slightly counteract drift due to wind.
- **Heading**: 270° (compensates for drift due to wind).

**Payload:**
- **Mass**: 0.2 kg (lighter to aid in reaching target apogee).
- **Position**: 0.9m to balance center of gravity.

Here's the refined configuration:

### Rationale
- **Motor**: The CesaroniO3700 delivers a higher impulse, improving the apogee achievement performance.
- **Materials**: Carbon fiber and composites offer a lightweight yet strong structure, balancing cost with necessary performance.
- **Aerodynamics**: The von Karman nose and sufficient fin span ensure reduced drag and stability.
- **Parachutes**: Larger parachute area ensures a safe landing.
- **Launch Setup**: Adjusted inclination helps counteract wind-induced drift.

This configuration aims to push closer to the target apogee, control costs, and ensure a structurally sound and safe recovery system.
