To develop an optimized rocket design, we must address the key shortcomings from the previous attempts, notably the targeting of apogee and cost-effectiveness without compromising structural integrity. Below is a comprehensive strategy that considers motor performance, material selection, aerodynamic efficiency, and cost management:

### Analysis from Previous Attempts:

1. **Motor Selection**: 
   - Finding the right motor that balances thrust and cost is crucial. The CesaroniM1670 has shown potential but underperformed in reaching the apogee. The CesaroniO3700 reached the target but was too costly.
   
2. **Material Choices**:
   - Utilizing lightweight and strong materials such as fiberglass for the body and carbon fiber for critical parts like the nose cone can provide structural integrity while reducing weight.
   
3. **Aerodynamics**:
   - A von Karman nose cone design effectively reduces drag. However, optimizing fin parameters is essential to enhance stability without adding excessive weight.

4. **Cost Management**:
   - Strategically using plywood or balsa wood for secondary components like fins can reduce costs while maintaining adequate strength.

### Design Strategy:

1. **Motor Choice**: 
   - **Motor**: AeroTechH128W
     - Although this motor provides less thrust, it will allow us to optimize the rest of the design to make full use of the given impulse while drastically reducing costs.
