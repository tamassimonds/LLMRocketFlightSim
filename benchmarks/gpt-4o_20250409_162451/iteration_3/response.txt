To improve upon the previous attempts, we need to address the structural integrity failure and reduce the cost while maintaining a close proximity to the target apogee. Let's go through the design process step by step, adjusting the previous setup to enhance performance while minimizing expenses.

### Key Adjustments Needed:
1. **Improve Structural Integrity**: Ensure the rocket handles stress without failure.
2. **Reduce Overall Cost**: Choose more cost-effective materials.
3. **Maintain Apogee Proximity**: Choose a balanced motor while considering the impulse needed.

### Design Adjustments:

#### Step 1: Motor Selection
- Motor performance is crucial for reaching the target apogee but must avoid excess weight and maintain cost limits.
- **New Motor**: Continue with the **CesaroniM1670**, providing a moderate balance between thrust and cost.
  
#### Step 2: Rocket Body Design
- **Radius and Length**: Maintain a radius of 0.1 meters and length of 2.8 meters to accommodate the motor, yet optimize for cost by reducing weight.
- **Material**: Switch to **aluminum** for the rocket body, which balances cost and structural strength at the expense of a slight increase in mass.
- **Thickness**: Set at 0.004 meters to ensure the structural integrity required for flight.

#### Step 3: Nose Cone Design
- **Kind**: Use a **tangent** shape for better aerodynamics.
- **Length and Material**: Use a length of 0.35 meters and **fiberglass** to maintain both durability and cost-effectiveness.

#### Step 4: Fin Design
- **Material**: Use **plywood** which is more economical than carbon fiber or balsa wood, especially for fins, where weight savings are secondary to cost.
- **Number and Dimensions**: Use 3 fins to reduce material cost, with dimensions adjusted for efficiency:
  - **Root Chord**: 0.22 meters
  - **Tip Chord**: 0.1 meters
  - **Span**: 0.3 meters
  - **Cant Angle**: 2 degrees for stability and minimal roll.
  - **Thickness**: 0.004 meters.

#### Step 5: Tail Design
- **Material**: Continue with **fiberglass** for cost and weight efficiency.
- Adjust **length** to 0.15 meters, with a **top radius** of 0.06 meters and **bottom radius** of 0.07 meters.

#### Step 6: Parachute Design
- **Main cd_s**: Optimize to 0.4 for adequate descent speed.
- **Drogue cd_s**: Optimize to 0.2 for initial descent stability.

#### Step 7: Launch Rail Configuration
- Maintain **rail length** at 6 meters, **inclination** at 87 degrees for slightly off-vertical launch, and **heading** at 270 degrees to compensate for easterly wind drift.

Here's the updated configuration:
