### Analysis of Previous Attempts

From the previous designs, we identified the following key learning points:

1. **Motor Selection**: Both excessive and insufficient motor thrust have been problematic. The CesaroniO3700 overshot the target, and smaller motors like AeroTechK700W insufficiently powered the rocket. An optimal choice would balance sufficient thrust and cost without significant overshooting or falling short.

2. **Material Choice**: Materials like carbon fiber provide excellent strength-to-weight ratios but can be costly if used extensively. Fiberglass is a good compromise, lightweight and affordable, suitable for most parts of the rocket.

3. **Aerodynamic Considerations**: The shape and material of the nose cone and fins significantly affect drag. The von Karman nose cone offers good aerodynamic efficiency.

### Design Strategy

1. **Motor Choice**: CesaroniM1670 has been identified as reasonable for maintaining a balance between the cost, impulse, and thrust needed to approach the target apogee better than underpowered solutions.

2. **Rocket Design**:
   - **Body**: Fiberglass with optimized dimensions for cost and weight balance, ensuring the structural integrity.
   - **Nose Cone**: Von Karman shape for drag reduction.
   - **Fins**: Positioned for stability, using lightweight materials such as balsa wood or plywood.

3. **Cost Management**: Use more economical materials where possible without excessive sacrifices on weight.

4. **Launch Offset**: Adjust rail inclination to slightly counter wind effects, reducing lateral drift without significant complexity.
