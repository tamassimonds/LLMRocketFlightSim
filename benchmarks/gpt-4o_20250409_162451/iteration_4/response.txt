To optimize the rocket design for achieving the target apogee of 3048 meters while minimizing costs and ensuring structural integrity, we need to make some strategic decisions regarding motor selection, material choices, and structural design. Let's analyze and plan the design step-by-step:

### Step 1: Motor Selection
We need a motor that successfully propels the rocket to the desired altitude. The previous attempts with the CesaroniO3700 resulted in an overshoot, while the CesaroniM1670 was insufficient.

- **Motor Choice**: **CesaroniO3700** is a good candidate given it has ample thrust and impulse for reaching close to the target apogee.

### Step 2: Rocket Body Design
For the rocket body, balancing strength, weight, and cost is critical.

- **Radius**: Maintain a radius of 0.16 meters to fit the motor comfortably.
- **Length**: Opt for a length of 3.5 meters for improved aerodynamics and stability.
- **Material**: Choose **fiberglass** for the rocket body to provide a good trade-off between cost, strength, and weight, as it is durable and relatively lightweight.
- **Thickness**: Set a thickness of 0.005 meters to ensure adequate strength.

### Step 3: Nose Cone Design
The nose cone shape impacts the rocket's drag and overall aerodynamics.

- **Kind**: Use an **ogive** shape, which efficiently minimizes drag.
- **Length**: Set the length to 0.5 meters to improve aerodynamic performance further.
- **Material**: Choose **fiberglass** to keep costs reasonable while ensuring robustness.

### Step 4: Fin Design
The fins are essential for stability in flight:

- **Number of Fins**: Use 4 fins for enhanced stability.
- **Root Chord**: Set it to 0.25 meters for better control.
- **Tip Chord**: 0.1 meters, to taper the fins for lower drag.
- **Span**: 0.3 meters to balance control and aerodynamics.
- **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees to reduce unnecessary rolling.
- **Material**: Use **carbon_fiber** for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio.
- **Thickness**: 0.003 meters to ensure they are not excessively heavy.

### Step 5: Tail Design
The tail stabilizes and directs the rocket, contributing to smooth flight.

- **Length**: 0.15 meters.
- **Top Radius**: 0.08 meters.
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.09 meters.
- **Material**: Use **fiberglass** for weight and cost efficiency.

### Step 6: Parachute Specifications
Sufficient parachute size is vital for safe recovery.

- **Main cd_s**: 0.5 for a controlled and slower descent to ensure safety.
- **Drogue cd_s**: 0.2 for initial deceleration without significant drift.

### Step 7: Launch Rail Configuration
The launch rail setup helps guide the rocket into a stable ascent:

- **Rail Length**: 7 meters for a stable launch trajectory.
- **Inclination**: 88 degrees to reduce the impact of wind slightly.
- **Heading**: Match the wind heading to 270 degrees to counteract wind effects.

### Step 8: Payload Consideration
Payload placement is critical for balance:

- **Mass**: 0.5 kg to allow for suitable instrumentation without excessive load.
- **Position**: 1.6 meters to keep the center of gravity toward the rocket's midpoint.

Here is the optimized design configuration:

### Summary
The updated configuration capitalizes on the powerful CesaroniO3700 motor, combined with strategic weight and cost reductions via material choices like fiberglass. These adjustments should provide the structural integrity needed while keeping the rocket's performance in line with the target apogee.
