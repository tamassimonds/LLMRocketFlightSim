To create a more optimized rocket design, we need a structured approach that incorporates insights from previous attempts while making fine-tuned adjustments. The main issues faced in previous trials were achieving the target apogee and managing costs without compromising structural integrity.

### Key Learnings from Previous Attempts:
1. **Motor Selection**: Finding a balance between thrust and efficiency is crucial. The AeroTechK700W, although cheaper, did not provide adequate thrust to achieve the desired apogee. Conversely, the CesaroniO3700 overshot the target apogee but had a high cost.
2. **Material Choice**: Lighter materials such as carbon fiber help reduce weight, improving altitude performance. However, cost must be controlled.
3. **Aerodynamics**: Choosing efficient shapes for the nose cone and fins can minimize drag and improve flight stability.

### Strategy for Improvement:
1. **Select a Motor that Balances Cost and Performance**: The CesaroniM1670 offers a middle ground with enough impulse to reach the target without overshooting excessively.
2. **Optimize Rocket Body Design**: Use materials like fiberglass and carbon fiber strategically to maintain a balance between weight and cost.
3. **Ensure Aerodynamic Efficiency**: The design should minimize drag to improve altitude performance.
