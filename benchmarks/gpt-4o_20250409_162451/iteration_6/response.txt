To enhance the previous rocket designs, we need to address the main issues raised by the tests: achieving the target apogee, minimizing costs, ensuring structural integrity, and managing safe descent speeds. Hereâ€™s a revised approach that considers more efficient combinations of components, materials, and motor selection:

### Design Strategy

#### Motor Selection:
- **Choice:** CesaroniK160
  - The CesaroniK160 offers a moderate range between thrust and impulse, which might help in balancing the cost-effectiveness without significantly compromising on the altitude, especially considering constraints from earlier designs with both overpowered and underpowered motors like the O3700 and K700W.

#### Rocket Body Design:
- **Radius:** 0.1 meters
  - This should comfortably fit most motor selections including the K160, keeping the design compact and weight-efficient.
- **Length:** 2.5 meters
  - Balances space for motor and payload, ensuring structural stability.
- **Material:** **fiberglass**
  - This material provides an economical solution with sufficient strength while keeping weight low.
- **Thickness:** 0.004 meters
  - Sufficient to maintain structural integrity while minimizing weight.

#### Nose Cone Design:
- **Kind:** **ogive**
  - Provides reduced drag, essential for efficient aerodynamic performance.
- **Length:** 0.4 meters
  - Matches the rocket's proportional size for optimal guidance in flight.
- **Material:** **fiberglass**
  - Ensures the nose cone is lightweight yet sturdy.

#### Fin Design:
- **Number:** 3
  - Allows for effective stabilization with reduced material costs.
- **Root Chord:** 0.2 meters
- **Tip Chord:** 0.1 meters
- **Span:** 0.25 meters
- **Cant Angle:** 2 degrees
  - Provides a slight spin stabilization without major performance alterations.
- **Material:** **plywood**
  - Cost-effective solution with adequate strength for stabilizing the rocket.
- **Thickness:** 0.003 meters

#### Tail Design:
- **Length:** 0.1 meters
- **Top Radius:** 0.08 meters
- **Bottom Radius:** 0.09 meters
- **Material:** **fiberglass**
  - Lightweight and durable, a consistent choice throughout the rocket.

#### Parachute Specifications:
- **Main cd_s:** 0.45
  - Provides controlled descent ensuring safety without excessive lateral drift.
- **Drogue cd_s:** 0.2
  - Provides initial stabilization during descent phase.

#### Launch Rail Configuration:
- **Rail Length:** 5 meters
  - Sufficient for stable take-off.
- **Inclination:** 85 degrees
  - Accounts for wind from the east, optimizing ascent trajectory.
- **Heading:** 270 degrees
  - Compensates for wind, reducing drift.

#### Payload:
- **Mass:** 0.4 kg
  - Provides essential equipment mass without excessive load.
- **Position:** 1.25 meters
  - Placing the payload near the center of the rocket for balance.

Here is the refined rocket design configuration:
