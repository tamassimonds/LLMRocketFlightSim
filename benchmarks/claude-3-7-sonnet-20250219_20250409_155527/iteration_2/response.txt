# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

I'll approach this rocket design systematically, focusing on reaching the target apogee while optimizing for cost, landing safety, structural integrity, and minimizing horizontal drift.

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I need to select an appropriate motor for our 3048m target. Let me analyze the thrust-to-weight ratio and total impulse needed:

For a 3048m apogee, we need sufficient impulse while balancing cost. Looking at the available motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Approx. Cost | Radius (mm) |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | Medium | 75 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 0.732 | Lower | 54 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium | 75 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 0.108 | Low | 29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | Very High | 161 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | Very High | 150 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | Low | 54 |

The previous attempt with AeroTechK700W undershot our target by about 26%. We need more impulse, but the O-class motors would be excessive and costly. The Pro75M1670 offers a good balance with about 2.7x the impulse of the K700W, which should get us closer to our target altitude.

## Rocket Mass and Structural Considerations

The previous design failed structurally, so I'll strengthen the design while keeping weight reasonable:
- Use stronger materials for critical components
- Increase wall thickness where needed
- Ensure proper fin attachment and reinforcement

## Body Design

I'll use carbon fiber for the body to provide strength while keeping weight down. The radius needs to be greater than the motor radius (75mm = 0.075m for Pro75M1670).

## Aerodynamic Design

For stability, I'll use:
- Ogive nose cone for good aerodynamic performance
- Four trapezoidal fins with appropriate dimensions
- Proper center of pressure and center of gravity relationship

## Parachute Design

For a safe landing (<5 m/s), I'll size the main parachute appropriately for the estimated total rocket mass of ~3.5kg.

## Wind Compensation

With 5 m/s easterly wind, I'll angle the launch rail slightly westward to minimize drift.

}
```

This design addresses the previous failure points:

1. **Motor Upgrade**: Using Pro75M1670 with significantly more impulse (6023.6 Ns vs 2249 Ns)
2. **Structural Integrity**: Using carbon fiber body and plywood fins for strength
3. **Increased Wall Thickness**: From 0.003m to 0.004m for better structural integrity
4. **Larger Parachute**: Increased CD_S to 1.5 for safer landing
5. **Longer Launch Rail**: 1.5m vs 1.0m for better initial stability
6. **Adjusted Dimensions**: Better proportioned fins and body for stability

The total mass should be around 3.5-4 kg, which with the Pro75M1670 motor's 6023.6 Ns impulse should reach close to our target apogee of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity.
