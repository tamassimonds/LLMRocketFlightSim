# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

# Rocket Design Analysis

I'll design a rocket to reach the target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) while optimizing for the scoring criteria. Let me work through this systematically.

## Initial Considerations

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048 meters
2. **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from East
3. **Scoring Factors**:
   - Distance to target apogee (primary)
   - Cost (cheaper is better)
   - Landing velocity (< 5 m/s for safety)
   - Structural integrity
   - Horizontal distance from launch site

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I need to select an appropriate motor. The motor should provide enough thrust to reach our target altitude without excessive overshoot.

Let's analyze the available motors:

| Motor | Avg Thrust (N) | Burn Time (s) | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 1533.9 | 3.9 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 658.7 | 3.5 | 2249 | 0.732 | Lower |
| CesaroniM1670 | 1533.9 | 3.6 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechH128W | 141.2 | 1.29 | 176.5 | 0.108 | Low |
| CesaroniO3700 | 2836.9 | 8.2 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | High |
| CesaroniO5800 | 5040.2 | 5.2 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniK160 | 190.2 | 9.7 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | Low |

For a 3048m apogee, we need a motor with sufficient impulse but not excessive. The CesaroniO motors are likely too powerful and expensive. The AeroTechH128W is too small. 

The Pro75M1670, CesaroniM1670, and AeroTechK700W seem most appropriate. Between these, the AeroTechK700W has a good balance of impulse and lower mass/cost.

## Rocket Mass Estimation

For a target apogee of 3048m, I'll aim for a total rocket mass (including motor) of approximately 2-3 kg. This should allow sufficient altitude with the AeroTechK700W motor.

## Body Design

I'll use a lightweight but strong material like fiberglass for the body. The radius needs to be greater than the motor radius (54mm = 0.054m for AeroTechK700W).

## Nose Cone Design

An ogive nose cone provides good aerodynamic performance. I'll use a lightweight material like fiberglass.

## Fin Design

Four fins provide good stability. I'll use a trapezoidal design with a moderate root chord and span, made from lightweight balsa wood.

## Parachute Design

For a safe landing (<5 m/s), I need appropriate parachute sizing:
- Terminal velocity = sqrt(2*m*g/(ρ*Cd*A))
- For a 2.5 kg rocket and 5 m/s landing speed: Cd*A ≈ 0.2 m²

## Launch Configuration

Given the 5 m/s easterly wind, I'll angle the launch rail slightly into the wind (westward) to minimize horizontal drift.

## Final Design Configuration

Based on these calculations and considerations, here's my optimized rocket design:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "AeroTechK700W",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.06,  # Body radius in meters (greater than motor radius of 0.054m)
        "length": 0.8,   # Body length in meters
        "material": "fiberglass",
        "thickness": 0.003,  # Wall thickness in meters
    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {
            "kind": "ogive",
            "length": 0.25,  # Nose cone length in meters
            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 4,
            "root_chord": 0.12,  # Fin root chord in meters
            "tip_chord": 0.06,   # Fin tip chord in meters
            "span": 0.08,        # Fin span in meters
            "cant_angle": 0,     # Cant angle in degrees
            "material": "balsa_wood",
            "thickness": 0.006   # Fin thickness in meters
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.1,  # Tail length in meters
            "top_radius": 0.055,  # Top radius in meters
            "bottom_radius": 0.06,  # Bottom radius in meters
            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.22,  # Main parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.05,  # Drogue parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.0,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 88,   # Rail inclination in degrees (slightly angled into wind)
        "heading": 270,      # Launch heading in degrees (westward to counter easterly wind)
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.3  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design balances all the scoring criteria:
1. Uses a moderately powered motor to reach target apogee
2. Uses lightweight materials to reduce cost
3. Has appropriately sized parachutes for safe landing
4. Has a structurally sound design with appropriate materials
5. Accounts for wind with a slight launch angle adjustment

The total mass should be around 2-2.5 kg, which with the AeroTechK700W motor's 2249 Ns impulse should reach close to our target apogee of 3048m.
Score: 14.16/100
Target Apogee: 3048.0m, Actual: 2252.27m, Error: 26.11%
Structural integrity: FAILED
Cost: $233.62


Based on previous attempts, please provide an improved rocket design.
