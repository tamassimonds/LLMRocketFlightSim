# Rocket Design Analysis

I'll design a rocket to reach the target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) while optimizing for the scoring criteria. Let me work through this systematically.

## Initial Considerations

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048 meters
2. **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from East
3. **Scoring Factors**:
   - Distance to target apogee (primary)
   - Cost (cheaper is better)
   - Landing velocity (< 5 m/s for safety)
   - Structural integrity
   - Horizontal distance from launch site

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I need to select an appropriate motor. The motor should provide enough thrust to reach our target altitude without excessive overshoot.

Let's analyze the available motors:

| Motor | Avg Thrust (N) | Burn Time (s) | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 1533.9 | 3.9 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 658.7 | 3.5 | 2249 | 0.732 | Lower |
| CesaroniM1670 | 1533.9 | 3.6 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechH128W | 141.2 | 1.29 | 176.5 | 0.108 | Low |
| CesaroniO3700 | 2836.9 | 8.2 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | High |
| CesaroniO5800 | 5040.2 | 5.2 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniK160 | 190.2 | 9.7 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | Low |

For a 3048m apogee, we need a motor with sufficient impulse but not excessive. The CesaroniO motors are likely too powerful and expensive. The AeroTechH128W is too small. 

The Pro75M1670, CesaroniM1670, and AeroTechK700W seem most appropriate. Between these, the AeroTechK700W has a good balance of impulse and lower mass/cost.

## Rocket Mass Estimation

For a target apogee of 3048m, I'll aim for a total rocket mass (including motor) of approximately 2-3 kg. This should allow sufficient altitude with the AeroTechK700W motor.

## Body Design

I'll use a lightweight but strong material like fiberglass for the body. The radius needs to be greater than the motor radius (54mm = 0.054m for AeroTechK700W).

## Nose Cone Design

An ogive nose cone provides good aerodynamic performance. I'll use a lightweight material like fiberglass.

## Fin Design

Four fins provide good stability. I'll use a trapezoidal design with a moderate root chord and span, made from lightweight balsa wood.

## Parachute Design

For a safe landing (<5 m/s), I need appropriate parachute sizing:
- Terminal velocity = sqrt(2*m*g/(ρ*Cd*A))
- For a 2.5 kg rocket and 5 m/s landing speed: Cd*A ≈ 0.2 m²

## Launch Configuration

Given the 5 m/s easterly wind, I'll angle the launch rail slightly into the wind (westward) to minimize horizontal drift.

## Final Design Configuration

Based on these calculations and considerations, here's my optimized rocket design:

```python

        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 4,
            "root_chord": 0.12,  # Fin root chord in meters

            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.22,  # Main parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.05,  # Drogue parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.0,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 88,   # Rail inclination in degrees (slightly angled into wind)
        "heading": 270,      # Launch heading in degrees (westward to counter easterly wind)
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.3  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design balances all the scoring criteria:
1. Uses a moderately powered motor to reach target apogee
2. Uses lightweight materials to reduce cost
3. Has appropriately sized parachutes for safe landing
4. Has a structurally sound design with appropriate materials
5. Accounts for wind with a slight launch angle adjustment

The total mass should be around 2-2.5 kg, which with the AeroTechK700W motor's 2249 Ns impulse should reach close to our target apogee of 3048m.
