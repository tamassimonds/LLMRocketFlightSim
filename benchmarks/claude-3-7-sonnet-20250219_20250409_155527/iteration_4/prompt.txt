# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

# Rocket Design Analysis

I'll design a rocket to reach the target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) while optimizing for the scoring criteria. Let me work through this systematically.

## Initial Considerations

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048 meters
2. **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from East
3. **Scoring Factors**:
   - Distance to target apogee (primary)
   - Cost (cheaper is better)
   - Landing velocity (< 5 m/s for safety)
   - Structural integrity
   - Horizontal distance from launch site

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I need to select an appropriate motor. The motor should provide enough thrust to reach our target altitude without excessive overshoot.

Let's analyze the available motors:

| Motor | Avg Thrust (N) | Burn Time (s) | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 1533.9 | 3.9 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 658.7 | 3.5 | 2249 | 0.732 | Lower |
| CesaroniM1670 | 1533.9 | 3.6 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechH128W | 141.2 | 1.29 | 176.5 | 0.108 | Low |
| CesaroniO3700 | 2836.9 | 8.2 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | High |
| CesaroniO5800 | 5040.2 | 5.2 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniK160 | 190.2 | 9.7 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | Low |

For a 3048m apogee, we need a motor with sufficient impulse but not excessive. The CesaroniO motors are likely too powerful and expensive. The AeroTechH128W is too small. 

The Pro75M1670, CesaroniM1670, and AeroTechK700W seem most appropriate. Between these, the AeroTechK700W has a good balance of impulse and lower mass/cost.

## Rocket Mass Estimation

For a target apogee of 3048m, I'll aim for a total rocket mass (including motor) of approximately 2-3 kg. This should allow sufficient altitude with the AeroTechK700W motor.

## Body Design

I'll use a lightweight but strong material like fiberglass for the body. The radius needs to be greater than the motor radius (54mm = 0.054m for AeroTechK700W).

## Nose Cone Design

An ogive nose cone provides good aerodynamic performance. I'll use a lightweight material like fiberglass.

## Fin Design

Four fins provide good stability. I'll use a trapezoidal design with a moderate root chord and span, made from lightweight balsa wood.

## Parachute Design

For a safe landing (<5 m/s), I need appropriate parachute sizing:
- Terminal velocity = sqrt(2*m*g/(ρ*Cd*A))
- For a 2.5 kg rocket and 5 m/s landing speed: Cd*A ≈ 0.2 m²

## Launch Configuration

Given the 5 m/s easterly wind, I'll angle the launch rail slightly into the wind (westward) to minimize horizontal drift.

## Final Design Configuration

Based on these calculations and considerations, here's my optimized rocket design:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "AeroTechK700W",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.06,  # Body radius in meters (greater than motor radius of 0.054m)
        "length": 0.8,   # Body length in meters
        "material": "fiberglass",
        "thickness": 0.003,  # Wall thickness in meters
    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {
            "kind": "ogive",
            "length": 0.25,  # Nose cone length in meters
            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 4,
            "root_chord": 0.12,  # Fin root chord in meters
            "tip_chord": 0.06,   # Fin tip chord in meters
            "span": 0.08,        # Fin span in meters
            "cant_angle": 0,     # Cant angle in degrees
            "material": "balsa_wood",
            "thickness": 0.006   # Fin thickness in meters
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.1,  # Tail length in meters
            "top_radius": 0.055,  # Top radius in meters
            "bottom_radius": 0.06,  # Bottom radius in meters
            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.22,  # Main parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.05,  # Drogue parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.0,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 88,   # Rail inclination in degrees (slightly angled into wind)
        "heading": 270,      # Launch heading in degrees (westward to counter easterly wind)
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.3  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design balances all the scoring criteria:
1. Uses a moderately powered motor to reach target apogee
2. Uses lightweight materials to reduce cost
3. Has appropriately sized parachutes for safe landing
4. Has a structurally sound design with appropriate materials
5. Accounts for wind with a slight launch angle adjustment

The total mass should be around 2-2.5 kg, which with the AeroTechK700W motor's 2249 Ns impulse should reach close to our target apogee of 3048m.
Score: 14.16/100
Target Apogee: 3048.0m, Actual: 2252.27m, Error: 26.11%

Design:
# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

I'll approach this rocket design systematically, focusing on reaching the target apogee while optimizing for cost, landing safety, structural integrity, and minimizing horizontal drift.

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I need to select an appropriate motor for our 3048m target. Let me analyze the thrust-to-weight ratio and total impulse needed:

For a 3048m apogee, we need sufficient impulse while balancing cost. Looking at the available motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Approx. Cost | Radius (mm) |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | Medium | 75 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 0.732 | Lower | 54 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium | 75 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 0.108 | Low | 29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | Very High | 161 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | Very High | 150 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | Low | 54 |

The previous attempt with AeroTechK700W undershot our target by about 26%. We need more impulse, but the O-class motors would be excessive and costly. The Pro75M1670 offers a good balance with about 2.7x the impulse of the K700W, which should get us closer to our target altitude.

## Rocket Mass and Structural Considerations

The previous design failed structurally, so I'll strengthen the design while keeping weight reasonable:
- Use stronger materials for critical components
- Increase wall thickness where needed
- Ensure proper fin attachment and reinforcement

## Body Design

I'll use carbon fiber for the body to provide strength while keeping weight down. The radius needs to be greater than the motor radius (75mm = 0.075m for Pro75M1670).

## Aerodynamic Design

For stability, I'll use:
- Ogive nose cone for good aerodynamic performance
- Four trapezoidal fins with appropriate dimensions
- Proper center of pressure and center of gravity relationship

## Parachute Design

For a safe landing (<5 m/s), I'll size the main parachute appropriately for the estimated total rocket mass of ~3.5kg.

## Wind Compensation

With 5 m/s easterly wind, I'll angle the launch rail slightly westward to minimize drift.

## Final Design Configuration

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "Pro75M1670",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.08,  # Body radius in meters (greater than motor radius of 0.075m)
        "length": 1.0,   # Body length in meters

            "material": "carbon_fiber",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 1.5,  # Main parachute CD_s for slower descent
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.1,  # Drogue parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.5,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 87,   # Rail inclination in degrees (slightly angled into wind)
        "heading": 270,      # Launch heading in degrees (westward to counter easterly wind)
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.4,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.2  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design addresses the previous failure points:

1. **Motor Upgrade**: Using Pro75M1670 with significantly more impulse (6023.6 Ns vs 2249 Ns)
2. **Structural Integrity**: Using carbon fiber body and plywood fins for strength
3. **Increased Wall Thickness**: From 0.003m to 0.004m for better structural integrity
4. **Larger Parachute**: Increased CD_S to 1.5 for safer landing
5. **Longer Launch Rail**: 1.5m vs 1.0m for better initial stability
6. **Adjusted Dimensions**: Better proportioned fins and body for stability

The total mass should be around 3.5-4 kg, which with the Pro75M1670 motor's 6023.6 Ns impulse should reach close to our target apogee of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity.
Score: 54.83/100

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

I'll design a rocket to reach the target apogee of 3048 meters while optimizing for all scoring criteria. Looking at the previous attempts, I can see that:

1. The first attempt with AeroTechK700W significantly undershot the target (2252m vs 3048m) and failed structurally
2. The second attempt with Pro75M1670 was much better (2833m vs 3048m) and passed structural tests, but was still short of the target and relatively expensive at $750

## Motor Selection Analysis

Let's analyze the motors more carefully:

The Pro75M1670 got us close but still undershot by about 7%. We need slightly more impulse but want to keep costs down. The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse as Pro75M1670 but is heavier and likely more expensive. The O-class motors are excessive.

I'll stick with the Pro75M1670 but optimize the rocket design to reduce weight and drag, which should allow us to reach our target altitude.

## Weight Optimization

To reach a higher apogee with the same motor, I need to:
1. Reduce overall weight where possible
2. Reduce drag by optimizing dimensions
3. Maintain structural integrity

## Material Selection

I'll use a mix of lightweight but strong materials:
- Carbon fiber for critical structural components
- Fiberglass for the nose cone
- Balsa wood for fins (lighter than plywood but still strong enough)

## Aerodynamic Optimization

- Streamlined ogive nose cone
- Optimized fin dimensions for stability with minimal drag
- Slightly smaller body diameter to reduce drag while maintaining structural integrity

## Parachute Design

For a safe landing (<5 m/s), I'll calculate the appropriate parachute size:
- Terminal velocity = sqrt(2*m*g/(ρ*Cd*A))
- For a ~3kg rocket and 5 m/s landing speed: Cd*A ≈ 1.2 m²

## Wind Compensation

With 5 m/s easterly wind, I'll angle the launch rail slightly westward to minimize drift.

This design improves upon the previous attempt by:

1. **Weight Reduction**: 
   - Using 3 fins instead of 4
   - Using balsa wood instead of plywood for fins
   - Slightly reducing body length and wall thickness
   - Reducing payload mass slightly

2. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Slightly smaller body radius
   - Optimized fin dimensions
   - Streamlined tail section

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Using balsa wood for fins reduces cost
   - Maintaining the Pro75M1670 motor which has good performance/cost ratio
   - Optimizing material usage

4. **Maintained Structural Integrity**:
   - Keeping carbon fiber for critical components
   - Maintaining adequate wall thickness
   - Proper fin dimensions and attachment

The total mass should be around 3-3.2 kg, which with the Pro75M1670 motor's 6023.6 Ns impulse should reach our target apogee of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity and keeping costs lower than the previous design.
Score: 29.87/100
Target Apogee: 3048.0m, Actual: 2908.64m, Error: 4.57%
Structural integrity: FAILED
Cost: $701.74


Based on previous attempts, please provide an improved rocket design.
