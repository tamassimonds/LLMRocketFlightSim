# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

I'll design a rocket to reach the target apogee of 3048 meters while optimizing for all scoring criteria. Looking at the previous attempts, I can see that:

1. The first attempt with AeroTechK700W significantly undershot the target (2252m vs 3048m) and failed structurally
2. The second attempt with Pro75M1670 was much better (2833m vs 3048m) and passed structural tests, but was still short of the target and relatively expensive at $750

## Motor Selection Analysis

Let's analyze the motors more carefully:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Avg Thrust (N) | Burn Time (s) | Radius (mm) |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | 1533.9 | 3.9 | 75 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 0.732 | 658.7 | 3.5 | 54 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | 1533.9 | 3.6 | 75 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 0.108 | 141.2 | 1.29 | 29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | 2836.9 | 8.2 | 161 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | 5040.2 | 5.2 | 150 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | 190.2 | 9.7 | 54 |

The Pro75M1670 got us close but still undershot by about 7%. We need slightly more impulse but want to keep costs down. The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse as Pro75M1670 but is heavier and likely more expensive. The O-class motors are excessive.

I'll stick with the Pro75M1670 but optimize the rocket design to reduce weight and drag, which should allow us to reach our target altitude.

## Weight Optimization

To reach a higher apogee with the same motor, I need to:
1. Reduce overall weight where possible
2. Reduce drag by optimizing dimensions
3. Maintain structural integrity

## Material Selection

I'll use a mix of lightweight but strong materials:
- Carbon fiber for critical structural components
- Fiberglass for the nose cone
- Balsa wood for fins (lighter than plywood but still strong enough)

## Aerodynamic Optimization

- Streamlined ogive nose cone
- Optimized fin dimensions for stability with minimal drag
- Slightly smaller body diameter to reduce drag while maintaining structural integrity

## Parachute Design

For a safe landing (<5 m/s), I'll calculate the appropriate parachute size:
- Terminal velocity = sqrt(2*m*g/(ρ*Cd*A))
- For a ~3kg rocket and 5 m/s landing speed: Cd*A ≈ 1.2 m²

## Wind Compensation

With 5 m/s easterly wind, I'll angle the launch rail slightly westward to minimize drift.

}
```

This design improves upon the previous attempt by:

1. **Weight Reduction**: 
   - Using 3 fins instead of 4
   - Using balsa wood instead of plywood for fins
   - Slightly reducing body length and wall thickness
   - Reducing payload mass slightly

2. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Slightly smaller body radius
   - Optimized fin dimensions
   - Streamlined tail section

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Using balsa wood for fins reduces cost
   - Maintaining the Pro75M1670 motor which has good performance/cost ratio
   - Optimizing material usage

4. **Maintained Structural Integrity**:
   - Keeping carbon fiber for critical components
   - Maintaining adequate wall thickness
   - Proper fin dimensions and attachment

The total mass should be around 3-3.2 kg, which with the Pro75M1670 motor's 6023.6 Ns impulse should reach our target apogee of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity and keeping costs lower than the previous design.
