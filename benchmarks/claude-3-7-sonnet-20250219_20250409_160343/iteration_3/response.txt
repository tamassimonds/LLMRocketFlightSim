# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Looking at the previous attempts, I notice several key issues:

1. **Underpowered motors**: Both designs undershot the target apogee by ~25%
2. **First design had structural failure** while the second design passed structural integrity
3. **Second design was costly** ($589.37) due to extensive aluminum usage
4. **Wind compensation** may need adjustment

## Motor Selection Analysis

For a 3048m apogee, we need more impulse than the K700W (2,249 Ns) but the Pro75M1670 (6,023.6 Ns) might be appropriate with a lighter structure. Let's compare the mid-range motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Diameter (mm) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 1.815 | 75 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 3.101 | 75 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2,249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 54 |

The Pro75M1670 offers the best impulse-to-weight ratio among these options. I'll select this motor but design a lighter structure than the previous attempt.

## Weight Optimization Strategy

To reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity:
1. Use composite materials instead of aluminum where appropriate
2. Optimize component dimensions
3. Reduce wall thickness where possible

## Body Design Calculations

For the Pro75M1670 motor (75mm diameter):
- Body radius: 0.08m (provides adequate clearance)
- Length: 0.9m (sufficient for motor and recovery system)
- Material: fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio at lower cost than carbon fiber)
- Thickness: 0.0035m (sufficient for structural integrity)

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Von Karman (optimal aerodynamic performance)
- Length: 0.28m (approximately 3.5x body radius)
- Material: fiberglass (consistent with body)

## Fin Design

For stability with reduced weight:
- 4 fins (good stability)
- Root chord: 0.16m
- Tip chord: 0.08m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.13m
- Material: plywood (good strength-to-weight ratio at lower cost)
- Thickness: 0.006m (increased for structural integrity)

## Tail Design

- Length: 0.18m
- Top radius: 0.075m
- Bottom radius: 0.08m (slightly different from top radius as required)
- Material: fiberglass (consistent with body)

## Parachute Sizing

Estimated rocket mass: ~3kg (motor + structure + payload)

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s):
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 3 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 0.96

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.8 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.2 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 86 degrees (increased westward tilt)
- Heading: 265 degrees (slightly south of west to account for drift)
- Rail length: 1.2m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Final Design

}
```

This design improves upon previous attempts by:

1. **Maintaining the Pro75M1670 motor** which has sufficient impulse
2. **Reducing weight** by using fiberglass instead of aluminum for the body and nose cone
3. **Using plywood for fins** which offers good strength at lower weight and cost
4. **Optimizing dimensions** to reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity
5. **Adjusting launch parameters** with a greater westward tilt to better compensate for wind
6. **Reducing payload mass** slightly to improve altitude performance

The fiberglass construction should provide sufficient structural integrity at a lower weight and cost compared to the all-aluminum design, while the Pro75M1670 motor should provide adequate impulse to reach our target apogee.
