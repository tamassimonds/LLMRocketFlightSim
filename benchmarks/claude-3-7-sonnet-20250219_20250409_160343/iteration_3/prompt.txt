# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

# Rocket Design Analysis

## Initial Considerations

To design a rocket that reaches a target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) in a 5 m/s easterly wind, I need to balance several factors:

1. **Motor selection**: Must provide enough thrust to reach target apogee without excessive overshoot
2. **Aerodynamic stability**: Proper center of pressure and center of gravity relationship
3. **Weight optimization**: Lighter materials where possible without compromising structural integrity
4. **Recovery system**: Ensure safe landing velocity (<5 m/s)
5. **Cost efficiency**: Minimize total cost while meeting performance requirements

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I'll analyze the available motors based on total impulse, which correlates with maximum altitude potential:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| CesaroniO5800 | 30,382.7 | 5,040.2 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29,930.2 | 2,836.9 | 14.194 | High |
| Pro75M1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 1.815 | Medium |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 2,249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | Medium-Low |
| CesaroniK160 | 1,521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | Low |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | Very Low |

For a 3048m apogee, the O-class motors are likely overkill and would increase cost significantly. The H-class motor is too small. The K and M class motors are more appropriate for our target altitude.

I'll select the **AeroTechK700W** as it provides a good balance of impulse to weight ratio and should be sufficient for our target altitude with proper rocket design.

## Body Design Calculations

For the AeroTechK700W motor:
- Radius: 54mm = 0.054m
- Length: 568mm = 0.568m

I'll design the body with:
- Radius: 0.06m (slightly larger than motor radius)
- Length: 0.8m (provides adequate space for motor and recovery system)
- Material: fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio at moderate cost)
- Thickness: 0.003m (sufficient for structural integrity)

## Nose Cone Design

An ogive shape provides good aerodynamic performance:
- Length: 0.25m (approximately 4x body radius)
- Material: ABS_plastic (lightweight, cost-effective)

## Fin Design

For stability, I'll use:
- 3 fins (minimum number for stability, reduces drag and weight)
- Root chord: 0.15m
- Tip chord: 0.08m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.12m
- Material: balsa_wood (very lightweight, adequate strength for this application)
- Thickness: 0.006m

## Tail Design

The tail will help with stability and motor mounting:
- Length: 0.15m
- Top radius: 0.055m
- Bottom radius: 0.06m
- Material: ABS_plastic

## Parachute Sizing

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s), I need to calculate appropriate parachute sizes.

Estimated rocket mass: ~2kg (motor + structure + payload)

For a 5 m/s descent rate:
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 2 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 0.64

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.5 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.15 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 88 degrees (slight westward tilt)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, opposite to wind direction)
- Rail length: 1.0m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Payload

- Mass: 0.3kg
- Position: 0.3m (forward of center to help with stability)

## Final Design

Based on these calculations and considerations, here's my optimized rocket design:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "AeroTechK700W",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.06,
        "length": 0.8,

            "span": 0.12,
            "cant_angle": 0,
            "material": "balsa_wood",
            "thickness": 0.006,
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.15,
            "top_radius": 0.055,
            "bottom_radius": 0.06,
            "material": "ABS_plastic",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.5,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.15,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.0,
        "inclination": 88,
        "heading": 270,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,
        "position": 0.3,
    }
}
```

This design balances performance requirements with cost efficiency. The K-class motor provides adequate thrust without being excessive, lightweight materials reduce overall mass, and the parachute system ensures a safe landing speed. The slight westward launch angle helps compensate for the easterly wind to minimize horizontal drift.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Initial Analysis and Approach

To design a rocket that successfully reaches 3048m (10,000 ft) apogee, I need to carefully balance thrust, weight, aerodynamics, and structural integrity while minimizing cost. The previous design failed structurally and undershot the target apogee by about 25%, so I'll need to make significant improvements.

## Motor Selection Analysis

Let's analyze the available motors based on their total impulse and thrust-to-weight ratio:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Thrust-to-Weight Ratio |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|------------------------|
| CesaroniO5800 | 30,382.7 | 5,040.2 | 12.418 | 41.5 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29,930.2 | 2,836.9 | 14.194 | 20.4 |
| Pro75M1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 1.815 | 86.3 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 3.101 | 50.6 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2,249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 92.0 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1,521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 27.8 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 133.7 |

The previous design used AeroTechK700W but underperformed. For a 3048m apogee, we need more impulse. The Pro75M1670 offers a good balance of total impulse (6,023.6 Ns) and thrust-to-weight ratio (86.3), making it suitable for our target altitude without excessive cost.

## Structural Integrity Considerations

The previous design failed structurally, likely due to:
1. Insufficient body thickness
2. Weak material choices in high-stress areas
3. Inadequate fin attachment or thickness

I'll address these by:
- Increasing body wall thickness
- Using stronger materials for critical components
- Ensuring proper fin design and attachment

## Body Design Calculations

For the Pro75M1670 motor:
- Radius: 75mm = 0.075m
- Length: 757mm = 0.757m

I'll design the body with:
- Radius: 0.085m (provides clearance for motor)
- Length: 1.0m (accommodates motor and recovery system)
- Material: aluminum (excellent strength-to-weight ratio)
- Thickness: 0.004m (increased for structural integrity)

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Von Karman (optimal aerodynamic performance)
- Length: 0.3m (approximately 3.5x body radius)
- Material: aluminum (consistent with body for structural integrity)

## Fin Design

For stability and structural integrity:
- 4 fins (increased stability)
- Root chord: 0.18m
- Tip chord: 0.09m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.14m
- Material: aluminum (consistent with body)
- Thickness: 0.005m (increased for structural integrity)

## Tail Design

- Length: 0.2m
- Top radius: 0.08m
- Bottom radius: 0.085m (slightly different from top radius as required)
- Material: aluminum (consistent with body)

## Parachute Sizing

Estimated rocket mass: ~3.5kg (motor + structure + payload)

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s):
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 3.5 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 1.12

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.9 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.22 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 87 degrees (slight westward tilt)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, opposite to wind direction)
- Rail length: 1.2m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Payload

- Mass: 0.4kg
- Position: 0.35m (forward of center to help with stability)

## Final Design

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "Pro75M1670",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.085,
        "length": 1.0,

        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 4,
            "root_chord": 0.18,
            "tip_chord": 0.09,
            "span": 0.14,
            "cant_angle": 0,
            "material": "aluminum",
            "thickness": 0.005,
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.2,
            "top_radius": 0.08,
            "bottom_radius": 0.085,
            "material": "aluminum",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.9,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.22,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.2,
        "inclination": 87,
        "heading": 270,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.4,
        "position": 0.35,
    }
}
```

This design addresses the previous failures by:
1. Using a more powerful motor (Pro75M1670) with sufficient impulse
2. Improving structural integrity with aluminum construction and increased thickness
3. Optimizing aerodynamics with a von Karman nose cone
4. Enhancing stability with 4 properly sized fins
5. Providing adequate parachute area for safe landing
6. Adjusting launch parameters to compensate for wind

The consistent use of aluminum throughout the design ensures structural integrity while maintaining a reasonable weight. The Pro75M1670 motor provides the necessary impulse to reach our target apogee without excessive cost.
