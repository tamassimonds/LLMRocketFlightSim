# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing all seven previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns and insights:

| Attempt | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Key Features |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | 2298.99 | 24.57% | FAILED | 209.18 | AeroTechK700W, thin walls |
| 2 | 2245.03 | 26.34% | PASSED | 589.37 | Pro75M1670, all aluminum |
| 3 | 2797.31 | 8.22% | PASSED | 623.77 | Pro75M1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 4 | 2804.20 | 8.00% | FAILED | 561.76 | Pro75M1670, lighter materials, thinner walls |
| 5 | 2783.61 | 8.67% | PASSED | 617.22 | Pro75M1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 6 | 2753.91 | 9.65% | PASSED | 637.32 | CesaroniM1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 7 | 2355.35 | 22.72% | PASSED | 293.30 | AeroTechK700W, carbon_fiber construction |

**Critical Insights:**
1. The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently gotten us closest to target (~8-9% error)
2. Attempt 4 came closest (8.00% error) but failed structurally
3. Carbon fiber is structurally sound but expensive
4. The K700W motor is insufficient even with lightweight construction
5. We need to optimize the Pro75M1670 design further

## Refined Design Strategy

For this attempt, I'll:
1. Return to the Pro75M1670 motor which has shown the best performance
2. Use a mix of lightweight but strong materials
3. Further optimize dimensions to reduce weight and drag
4. Fine-tune launch parameters to account for wind
5. Balance cost with performance

## Motor Selection

The Pro75M1670 (6,023.6 Ns total impulse) has consistently gotten us closest to our target. With proper optimization, this motor should be sufficient.

## Body Design Calculations

For the Pro75M1670 motor (75mm diameter):
- Body radius: 0.078m (minimal clearance to reduce weight and drag)
- Length: 0.8m (optimized for weight while providing sufficient space)
- Material: fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio at moderate cost)
- Thickness: 0.0032m (optimized for structural integrity)

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Von Karman (optimal aerodynamic performance)
- Length: 0.23m (approximately 3x body radius)
- Material: ABS_plastic (lighter than fiberglass with adequate strength)

## Fin Design

For stability with minimal drag:
- 3 fins (reduced drag while maintaining stability)
- Root chord: 0.14m
- Tip chord: 0.07m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.11m
- Material: plywood (good strength-to-weight ratio at lower cost)
- Thickness: 0.007m (optimized for structural integrity)

## Tail Design

- Length: 0.15m
- Top radius: 0.076m
- Bottom radius: 0.078m (minimal difference to maintain structural requirements)
- Material: ABS_plastic (lighter than fiberglass)

## Parachute Sizing

Estimated rocket mass: ~2.7kg

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s):
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 2.7 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 0.86

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.72 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.14 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 84.5 degrees (westward tilt)
- Heading: 265 degrees (adjusted to account for drift)
- Rail length: 1.1m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Payload

- Mass: 0.25kg (minimized to improve altitude)
- Position: 0.22m (forward of center to help with stability)

## Final Design

This design combines the best elements of previous attempts:

1. **Using the Pro75M1670 motor** which has consistently performed best
2. **Optimizing weight** through:
   - Compact body dimensions
   - Lightweight ABS_plastic for nose cone and tail
   - Plywood fins
   - Reduced payload mass
3. **Ensuring structural integrity** with:
   - Fiberglass body with appropriate thickness (0.0032m)
   - Adequate fin thickness (0.007m)
4. **Reducing drag** with:
   - Optimized nose cone design
   - Streamlined fin configuration
5. **Balancing cost** by:
   - Using ABS_plastic where appropriate
   - Using plywood for fins
   - Optimizing dimensions to reduce material usage
6. **Fine-tuning launch parameters** with:
   - 84.5-degree inclination
   - 265-degree heading

This design should reach very close to our target apogee while maintaining structural integrity and optimizing cost, based on the lessons learned from all previous attempts.
