# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Initial Analysis and Approach

To design a rocket that successfully reaches 3048m (10,000 ft) apogee, I need to carefully balance thrust, weight, aerodynamics, and structural integrity while minimizing cost. The previous design failed structurally and undershot the target apogee by about 25%, so I'll need to make significant improvements.

## Motor Selection Analysis

Let's analyze the available motors based on their total impulse and thrust-to-weight ratio:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Thrust-to-Weight Ratio |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|------------------------|
| CesaroniO5800 | 30,382.7 | 5,040.2 | 12.418 | 41.5 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29,930.2 | 2,836.9 | 14.194 | 20.4 |
| Pro75M1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 1.815 | 86.3 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 3.101 | 50.6 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2,249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 92.0 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1,521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 27.8 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 133.7 |

The previous design used AeroTechK700W but underperformed. For a 3048m apogee, we need more impulse. The Pro75M1670 offers a good balance of total impulse (6,023.6 Ns) and thrust-to-weight ratio (86.3), making it suitable for our target altitude without excessive cost.

## Structural Integrity Considerations

The previous design failed structurally, likely due to:
1. Insufficient body thickness
2. Weak material choices in high-stress areas
3. Inadequate fin attachment or thickness

I'll address these by:
- Increasing body wall thickness
- Using stronger materials for critical components
- Ensuring proper fin design and attachment

## Body Design Calculations

For the Pro75M1670 motor:
- Radius: 75mm = 0.075m
- Length: 757mm = 0.757m

I'll design the body with:
- Radius: 0.085m (provides clearance for motor)
- Length: 1.0m (accommodates motor and recovery system)
- Material: aluminum (excellent strength-to-weight ratio)
- Thickness: 0.004m (increased for structural integrity)

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Von Karman (optimal aerodynamic performance)
- Length: 0.3m (approximately 3.5x body radius)
- Material: aluminum (consistent with body for structural integrity)

## Fin Design

For stability and structural integrity:
- 4 fins (increased stability)
- Root chord: 0.18m
- Tip chord: 0.09m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.14m
- Material: aluminum (consistent with body)
- Thickness: 0.005m (increased for structural integrity)

## Tail Design

- Length: 0.2m
- Top radius: 0.08m
- Bottom radius: 0.085m (slightly different from top radius as required)
- Material: aluminum (consistent with body)

## Parachute Sizing

Estimated rocket mass: ~3.5kg (motor + structure + payload)

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s):
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 3.5 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 1.12

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.9 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.22 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 87 degrees (slight westward tilt)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, opposite to wind direction)
- Rail length: 1.2m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Payload

- Mass: 0.4kg
- Position: 0.35m (forward of center to help with stability)

## Final Design

```

This design addresses the previous failures by:
1. Using a more powerful motor (Pro75M1670) with sufficient impulse
2. Improving structural integrity with aluminum construction and increased thickness
3. Optimizing aerodynamics with a von Karman nose cone
4. Enhancing stability with 4 properly sized fins
5. Providing adequate parachute area for safe landing
6. Adjusting launch parameters to compensate for wind

The consistent use of aluminum throughout the design ensures structural integrity while maintaining a reasonable weight. The Pro75M1670 motor provides the necessary impulse to reach our target apogee without excessive cost.
