# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing the six previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns:

| Attempt | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Key Features |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | 2298.99 | 24.57% | FAILED | 209.18 | AeroTechK700W, thin walls |
| 2 | 2245.03 | 26.34% | PASSED | 589.37 | Pro75M1670, all aluminum |
| 3 | 2797.31 | 8.22% | PASSED | 623.77 | Pro75M1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 4 | 2804.20 | 8.00% | FAILED | 561.76 | Pro75M1670, lighter materials, thinner walls |
| 5 | 2783.61 | 8.67% | PASSED | 617.22 | Pro75M1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 6 | 2753.91 | 9.65% | PASSED | 637.32 | CesaroniM1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |

**Critical Insights:**
1. We're consistently undershooting the target apogee by ~8-10% with M-class motors
2. The Pro75M1670 has performed better than the CesaroniM1670 despite identical impulse
3. We need a more powerful motor to reach our target altitude
4. Structural integrity requires appropriate material thickness
5. Cost optimization is needed while maintaining performance

## New Design Strategy

For this attempt, I'll:
1. Use the AeroTechK700W motor with a significantly lighter structure
2. Optimize aerodynamics for maximum altitude
3. Use lightweight but strong materials
4. Adjust launch parameters for optimal trajectory

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

The M-class motors are getting us to ~90% of our target. The K700W has about 37% of the impulse of the M1670, but if we can reduce the rocket weight by more than 60%, we might achieve better performance with the lighter motor.

## Body Design Calculations

For the AeroTechK700W motor (54mm diameter):
- Body radius: 0.058m (minimal clearance to reduce weight and drag)
- Length: 0.65m (minimized for weight reduction)
- Material: carbon_fiber (highest strength-to-weight ratio)
- Thickness: 0.0025m (optimized for structural integrity with strong material)

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Von Karman (optimal aerodynamic performance)
- Length: 0.2m (approximately 3.5x body radius)
- Material: carbon_fiber (consistent with body)

## Fin Design

For stability with minimal weight:
- 3 fins (reduced drag while maintaining stability)
- Root chord: 0.12m
- Tip chord: 0.06m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.09m (optimized for stability with minimal weight)
- Material: carbon_fiber (highest strength-to-weight ratio)
- Thickness: 0.003m (minimized with strong material)

## Tail Design

- Length: 0.12m
- Top radius: 0.056m
- Bottom radius: 0.058m (minimal difference to maintain structural requirements)
- Material: carbon_fiber (consistent with body)

## Parachute Sizing

Estimated rocket mass: ~1.5kg (significantly reduced from previous designs)

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s):
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 1.5 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 0.48

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.4 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.08 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 88 degrees (slight westward tilt)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, opposite to wind direction)
- Rail length: 1.0m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Payload

- Mass: 0.2kg (minimized to improve altitude)
- Position: 0.2m (forward of center to help with stability)

```

This design represents a significant departure from previous attempts by:

1. **Using a smaller, lighter motor** (AeroTechK700W) to reduce weight
2. **Minimizing overall weight** through:
   - Carbon fiber construction throughout (highest strength-to-weight ratio)
   - Reduced dimensions for all components
   - Minimized payload mass
3. **Optimizing aerodynamics** with:
   - Minimal body diameter
   - Optimized nose cone and fin design
4. **Ensuring structural integrity** with:
   - Carbon fiber's superior strength properties
   - Appropriate wall thickness for the material
5. **Adjusting launch parameters** for optimal trajectory

By dramatically reducing weight while maintaining structural integrity, this design aims to achieve our target apogee with a smaller motor, which should also reduce overall cost compared to previous designs.
