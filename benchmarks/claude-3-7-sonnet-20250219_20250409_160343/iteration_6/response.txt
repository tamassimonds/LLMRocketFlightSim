# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

Analyzing the five previous attempts reveals important patterns:

| Attempt | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Key Features |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | 2298.99 | 24.57% | FAILED | 209.18 | AeroTechK700W, thin walls |
| 2 | 2245.03 | 26.34% | PASSED | 589.37 | Pro75M1670, all aluminum |
| 3 | 2797.31 | 8.22% | PASSED | 623.77 | Pro75M1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 4 | 2804.20 | 8.00% | FAILED | 561.76 | Pro75M1670, lighter materials, thinner walls |
| 5 | 2783.61 | 8.67% | PASSED | 617.22 | Pro75M1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |

**Key Insights:**
1. The Pro75M1670 motor consistently gets us within ~8-9% of target apogee
2. We need a slightly more powerful motor or further weight reduction
3. Structural integrity requires appropriate material thickness
4. Cost optimization is needed while maintaining performance

## Refined Design Strategy

For this attempt, I'll:
1. Use the CesaroniM1670 motor (same impulse as Pro75M1670 but different thrust profile)
2. Further optimize weight while maintaining structural integrity
3. Refine aerodynamics to reduce drag
4. Adjust launch parameters for optimal trajectory

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

The CesaroniM1670 has identical total impulse (6,023.6 Ns) to the Pro75M1670 but with a slightly different thrust profile. This might provide the small boost needed to reach our target apogee.

## Body Design Calculations

For the CesaroniM1670 motor (75mm diameter):
- Body radius: 0.079m (minimal clearance to reduce weight and drag)
- Length: 0.82m (optimized for weight)
- Material: fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio)
- Thickness: 0.0033m (optimized for structural integrity)

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Von Karman (optimal aerodynamic performance)
- Length: 0.24m (approximately 3x body radius)
- Material: fiberglass (consistent with body)

## Fin Design

For stability with minimal drag:
- 3 fins (reduced drag while maintaining stability)
- Root chord: 0.15m
- Tip chord: 0.075m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.11m (reduced to minimize weight and drag)
- Material: plywood (good strength-to-weight ratio)
- Thickness: 0.007m (optimized for structural integrity)

## Tail Design

- Length: 0.16m
- Top radius: 0.077m
- Bottom radius: 0.079m (minimal difference to maintain structural requirements)
- Material: fiberglass (consistent with body)

## Parachute Sizing

Estimated rocket mass: ~2.8kg

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s):
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 2.8 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 0.9

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.75 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.15 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 84 degrees (increased westward tilt)
- Heading: 264 degrees (adjusted to account for drift)
- Rail length: 1.1m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Payload

- Mass: 0.28kg (reduced to improve altitude)
- Position: 0.25m (forward of center to help with stability)

## Final Design

This design improves upon previous attempts by:

1. **Switching to CesaroniM1670 motor** which has the same impulse but a different thrust profile
2. **Further optimizing weight** through:
   - Reduced body length (0.82m vs 0.85m)
   - Smaller fin dimensions
   - Reduced payload mass (0.28kg vs 0.32kg)
3. **Maintaining structural integrity** with:
   - Fiberglass construction for body, nose cone, and tail
   - Appropriate wall thickness (0.0033m)
   - Plywood fins with adequate thickness (0.007m)
4. **Improving aerodynamics** with:
   - Optimized nose cone length
   - Reduced fin size
5. **Adjusting launch parameters** with:
   - 84-degree inclination (increased westward tilt)
   - 264-degree heading (adjusted for wind)

The combination of these optimizations should allow us to reach closer to our target apogee while maintaining structural integrity and optimizing cost.
