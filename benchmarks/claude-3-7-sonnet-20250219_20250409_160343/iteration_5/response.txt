# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

Analyzing the four previous attempts reveals critical patterns:

| Attempt | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Key Features |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | 2298.99 | 24.57% | FAILED | 209.18 | AeroTechK700W, thin walls |
| 2 | 2245.03 | 26.34% | PASSED | 589.37 | Pro75M1670, all aluminum |
| 3 | 2797.31 | 8.22% | PASSED | 623.77 | Pro75M1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 4 | 2804.20 | 8.00% | FAILED | 561.76 | Pro75M1670, lighter materials, thinner walls |

**Key Insights:**
1. The Pro75M1670 motor gets us closest to target apogee
2. Attempt 3 had structural integrity but was costly
3. Attempt 4 improved apogee and reduced cost but failed structurally
4. We need to balance weight reduction with structural integrity

## Refined Design Strategy

I'll use the Pro75M1670 motor with a design that:
1. Maintains structural integrity with appropriate materials and thicknesses
2. Optimizes weight without compromising strength
3. Reduces cost by using affordable materials where appropriate
4. Adjusts launch parameters to account for wind

## Motor Selection Confirmation

The Pro75M1670 (6,023.6 Ns total impulse) has consistently gotten us closest to our target. With proper weight optimization and structural considerations, this motor should be sufficient.

## Body Design Calculations

For the Pro75M1670 motor (75mm diameter):
- Body radius: 0.08m (provides adequate clearance)
- Length: 0.85m (optimized for weight while providing sufficient space)
- Material: fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio at moderate cost)
- Thickness: 0.0035m (increased from attempt 4 to ensure structural integrity)

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Von Karman (optimal aerodynamic performance)
- Length: 0.26m (approximately 3.25x body radius)
- Material: fiberglass (consistent with body for structural integrity)

## Fin Design

For stability with structural integrity:
- 3 fins (reduced drag while maintaining stability)
- Root chord: 0.16m
- Tip chord: 0.08m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.12m
- Material: plywood (good strength-to-weight ratio at lower cost)
- Thickness: 0.008m (increased to ensure structural integrity)

## Tail Design

- Length: 0.17m
- Top radius: 0.076m
- Bottom radius: 0.08m (difference maintained for structural requirements)
- Material: fiberglass (consistent with body for structural integrity)

## Parachute Sizing

Estimated rocket mass: ~2.9kg

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s):
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 2.9 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 0.93

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.78 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.15 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 85 degrees (westward tilt)
- Heading: 262 degrees (adjusted to account for drift)
- Rail length: 1.2m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Payload

- Mass: 0.32kg
- Position: 0.28m (forward of center to help with stability)

## Final Design

This design combines the best elements of previous attempts:

1. **Structural integrity** is ensured by:
   - Using fiberglass for body, nose cone, and tail
   - Increasing wall thickness to 0.0035m (from 0.003m in attempt 4)
   - Using plywood for fins with adequate thickness (0.008m)

2. **Weight optimization** is achieved through:
   - Compact body dimensions
   - 3 fins instead of 4
   - Optimized component dimensions

3. **Cost efficiency** is improved by:
   - Using plywood for fins instead of more expensive materials
   - Optimizing dimensions to reduce material usage
   - Balancing performance with material selection

4. **Wind compensation** is addressed with:
   - 85-degree inclination (westward tilt)
   - 262-degree heading

This design should reach very close to our target apogee while maintaining structural integrity and optimizing cost, based on the lessons learned from all previous attempts.
