# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing all eight previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns and insights:

| Attempt | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Key Features |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | 2298.99 | 24.57% | FAILED | 209.18 | AeroTechK700W, thin walls |
| 2 | 2245.03 | 26.34% | PASSED | 589.37 | Pro75M1670, all aluminum |
| 3 | 2797.31 | 8.22% | PASSED | 623.77 | Pro75M1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 4 | 2804.20 | 8.00% | FAILED | 561.76 | Pro75M1670, lighter materials, thinner walls |
| 5 | 2783.61 | 8.67% | PASSED | 617.22 | Pro75M1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 6 | 2753.91 | 9.65% | PASSED | 637.32 | CesaroniM1670, fiberglass body, plywood fins |
| 7 | 2355.35 | 22.72% | PASSED | 293.30 | AeroTechK700W, carbon_fiber construction |
| 8 | 2799.64 | 8.15% | PASSED | 561.47 | Pro75M1670, mixed materials |

**Key Insights:**
1. The Pro75M1670 motor consistently gets us closest to target (~8-9% error)
2. We need to increase altitude by ~250m to reach our target
3. Structural integrity requires appropriate material thickness
4. Mixed materials (fiberglass body, ABS nose/tail, plywood fins) provide good balance of weight, strength, and cost
5. Launch angle adjustments help compensate for wind

## Refined Design Strategy

For this final attempt, I'll:
1. Continue with the Pro75M1670 motor which has shown the best performance
2. Further reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity
3. Optimize aerodynamics to reduce drag
4. Fine-tune launch parameters for optimal trajectory
5. Consider a slightly more aggressive design approach to reach target apogee

## Motor Selection

The Pro75M1670 (6,023.6 Ns total impulse) has consistently gotten us closest to our target. With proper optimization, this motor should be sufficient.

## Body Design Calculations

For the Pro75M1670 motor (75mm diameter):
- Body radius: 0.077m (minimal clearance to reduce weight and drag)
- Length: 0.77m (reduced to minimize weight)
- Material: fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio)
- Thickness: 0.003m (optimized for structural integrity)

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Von Karman (optimal aerodynamic performance)
- Length: 0.22m (approximately 2.85x body radius)
- Material: ABS_plastic (lighter than fiberglass with adequate strength)

## Fin Design

For stability with minimal drag:
- 3 fins (reduced drag while maintaining stability)
- Root chord: 0.13m (reduced to minimize weight)
- Tip chord: 0.065m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.105m (optimized for stability with minimal weight)
- Material: balsa_wood (very lightweight with adequate strength when properly sized)
- Thickness: 0.009m (increased thickness to ensure structural integrity with lighter material)

## Tail Design

- Length: 0.14m (reduced to minimize weight)
- Top radius: 0.075m
- Bottom radius: 0.077m (minimal difference to maintain structural requirements)
- Material: ABS_plastic (lighter than fiberglass)

## Parachute Sizing

Estimated rocket mass: ~2.6kg (reduced from previous designs)

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s):
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 2.6 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 0.83

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.7 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.13 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 83 degrees (increased westward tilt to reduce horizontal distance)
- Heading: 268 degrees (adjusted to account for drift)
- Rail length: 1.0m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Payload

- Mass: 0.22kg (minimized to improve altitude)
- Position: 0.2m (forward of center to help with stability)

## Final Design

This design improves upon previous attempts by:

1. **Further reducing weight** through:
   - Shorter body length (0.77m vs 0.8m)
   - Smaller nose cone (0.22m vs 0.23m)
   - Reduced fin dimensions
   - Using balsa_wood for fins (lighter than plywood)
   - Reduced payload mass (0.22kg vs 0.25kg)
   - Shorter tail section (0.14m vs 0.15m)

2. **Maintaining structural integrity** with:
   - Fiberglass body with appropriate thickness
   - Increased fin thickness (0.009m) to compensate for lighter balsa_wood material

3. **Optimizing aerodynamics** with:
   - Minimal body diameter
   - Streamlined nose cone and fin design

4. **Adjusting launch parameters** with:
   - More aggressive westward tilt (83 degrees)
   - Fine-tuned heading (268 degrees)

5. **Balancing cost** by:
   - Using ABS_plastic where appropriate
   - Using balsa_wood for fins
   - Optimizing dimensions to reduce material usage

This design represents the culmination of lessons learned from all previous attempts, with careful optimization of every component to maximize altitude while maintaining structural integrity and minimizing cost.
