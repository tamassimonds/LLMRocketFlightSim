# Rocket Design Analysis

## Initial Considerations

To design a rocket that reaches a target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) in a 5 m/s easterly wind, I need to balance several factors:

1. **Motor selection**: Must provide enough thrust to reach target apogee without excessive overshoot
2. **Aerodynamic stability**: Proper center of pressure and center of gravity relationship
3. **Weight optimization**: Lighter materials where possible without compromising structural integrity
4. **Recovery system**: Ensure safe landing velocity (<5 m/s)
5. **Cost efficiency**: Minimize total cost while meeting performance requirements

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I'll analyze the available motors based on total impulse, which correlates with maximum altitude potential:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| CesaroniO5800 | 30,382.7 | 5,040.2 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29,930.2 | 2,836.9 | 14.194 | High |
| Pro75M1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 1.815 | Medium |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6,023.6 | 1,533.9 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 2,249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | Medium-Low |
| CesaroniK160 | 1,521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | Low |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | Very Low |

For a 3048m apogee, the O-class motors are likely overkill and would increase cost significantly. The H-class motor is too small. The K and M class motors are more appropriate for our target altitude.

I'll select the **AeroTechK700W** as it provides a good balance of impulse to weight ratio and should be sufficient for our target altitude with proper rocket design.

## Body Design Calculations

For the AeroTechK700W motor:
- Radius: 54mm = 0.054m
- Length: 568mm = 0.568m

I'll design the body with:
- Radius: 0.06m (slightly larger than motor radius)
- Length: 0.8m (provides adequate space for motor and recovery system)
- Material: fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio at moderate cost)
- Thickness: 0.003m (sufficient for structural integrity)

## Nose Cone Design

An ogive shape provides good aerodynamic performance:
- Length: 0.25m (approximately 4x body radius)
- Material: ABS_plastic (lightweight, cost-effective)

## Fin Design

For stability, I'll use:
- 3 fins (minimum number for stability, reduces drag and weight)
- Root chord: 0.15m
- Tip chord: 0.08m (tapered for reduced drag)
- Span: 0.12m
- Material: balsa_wood (very lightweight, adequate strength for this application)
- Thickness: 0.006m

## Tail Design

The tail will help with stability and motor mounting:
- Length: 0.15m
- Top radius: 0.055m
- Bottom radius: 0.06m
- Material: ABS_plastic

## Parachute Sizing

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s), I need to calculate appropriate parachute sizes.

Estimated rocket mass: ~2kg (motor + structure + payload)

For a 5 m/s descent rate:
Cd_S = 2 × mass × g / (ρ × v²)
Cd_S = 2 × 2 × 9.81 / (1.225 × 5²)
Cd_S ≈ 0.64

I'll split this between main and drogue:
- Main: Cd_S = 0.5 (for final descent)
- Drogue: Cd_S = 0.15 (for initial descent)

## Launch Configuration

To compensate for the easterly wind:
- Inclination: 88 degrees (slight westward tilt)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, opposite to wind direction)
- Rail length: 1.0m (provides adequate stability during initial acceleration)

## Payload

- Mass: 0.3kg
- Position: 0.3m (forward of center to help with stability)

## Final Design

Based on these calculations and considerations, here's my optimized rocket design:

```python

            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.15,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.0,
        "inclination": 88,
        "heading": 270,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,
        "position": 0.3,
    }
}
```

This design balances performance requirements with cost efficiency. The K-class motor provides adequate thrust without being excessive, lightweight materials reduce overall mass, and the parachute system ensures a safe landing speed. The slight westward launch angle helps compensate for the easterly wind to minimize horizontal drift.
