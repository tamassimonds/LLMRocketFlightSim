Below is a step-by-step outline of the thought process for arriving at an improved rocket design based on the previous attempts. After this reasoning, you will find a “config” dictionary in the exact format required. No extra Python code is included.

REASONING & DESIGN CHOICES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Why the K700 Motor
• The AeroTechK700W supplies ~2249 Ns of total impulse.  
• That proved sufficient in earlier attempts to reach near 3048 m, if the rocket was not too heavy.  
• Larger motors (e.g., “M” or “O” class) would be more expensive and risk overshooting the target, while smaller motors would not provide enough impulse.  

2) Body Radius Must Be Greater Than 54 mm
• A key DRC rule is that the rocket body radius must exceed the motor’s 54 mm.  
• Previous attempts with < 0.054 m body radius were invalid or experienced structural failures in the simulator.  
• Thus, we choose a 0.055 m rocket body radius to pass the motor fit requirement while still keeping diameter modest.

3) Balancing Structural Integrity and Mass
• Attempt 4 was structurally sound (no failure) but reached only ~2129 m, suggesting it was too heavy or had too much drag.  
• To reduce mass and keep decent strength, we use fiberglass (generally cheaper and lighter than some “composite” blends) with 2 mm thickness on the main body.  
• Fins also made of fiberglass at 2 mm thickness to reduce weight versus thicker or denser materials.

4) Nose Cone
• An ogive shape (0.25 m length) remains a good aerodynamic choice.  
• Same fiberglass material (2 mm wall) to maintain uniform manufacturing and cost savings.

5) Fin Geometry
• Three fins (root chord 0.14 m, tip chord 0.06 m, span 0.11 m) provide adequate stability with lower drag and cost than four fins.  
• Zero cant angle to reduce roll and horizontal drift.  
• Fiberglass at 0.002 m thickness is chosen to improve strength without excessive weight or cost.

6) Tail Section
• A short tail (0.10 m length) helps transition from the main body to the motor nozzle area.  
• Top radius = 0.055 m and bottom radius = 0.06 m, ensuring they are not identical (avoiding DRC errors).  
• Fiberglass again for consistency and cost considerations.

7) Parachutes
• Main chute Cd·S = 2.4 to achieve ~5 m/s or lower landing speed if the rocket mass is in the 3.5–4.5 kg range.  
• Drogue chute Cd·S = 0.2 to stabilize descent immediately after apogee.

8) Launch Setup & Wind
• Launch rail length of 2.2 m, giving the rocket more distance to reach safe speed off the rail.  
• Inclination of 88 ° (close to vertical) and heading of 270 ° (west) to counter moderate easterly winds of ~5 m/s.

9) Payload
• A 0.6 kg mass at 0.65 m from the rocket center helps set the center of gravity forward.  
• Keeps the total launch mass from becoming too high while still carrying a practical payload.
