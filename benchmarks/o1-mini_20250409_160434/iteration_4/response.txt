## Design Process and Reasoning

### **1. Motor Selection**

#### **Available Motors Analysis**

To achieve an apogee of 3,048 meters, selecting the appropriate motor is crucial. Here's a summary of the available motors:

| **Motor**          | **Total Impulse (Ns)** | **Max Thrust (N)** | **Burn Time (s)** | **Isp (s)** |
|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Pro75M1670**         | 6,023.6                | 2,200              | 3.9                | 198         |
| **AeroTechK700W**      | 2,249                  | 1,029.3            | 3.5                | 177.5       |
| **CesaroniM1670**      | 6,023.6                | 2,200              | 3.6                | 198         |
| **AeroTechH128W**      | 176.5                  | 190.5              | 1.29               | 191.3       |
| **CesaroniO3700**      | 29,930.2               | 4,030.3            | 8.2                | 177.8       |
| **CesaroniO5800**      | 30,382.7               | 6,395.5            | 5.2                | 222         |
| **CesaroniK160**       | 1,521.7                | 272.2              | 9.7                | 182.9       |

#### **Selection Criteria**

- **Total Impulse (Ns)**: Higher total impulse generally contributes to achieving a higher apogee.
- **Thrust (N)**: Sufficient thrust ensures effective lift-off and acceleration.
- **Specific Impulse (Isp)**: Higher Isp indicates better fuel efficiency.
- **Cost Consideration**: Balancing performance with budget constraints.

#### **Chosen Motor: **CesaroniO5800****

- **Total Impulse**: 30,382.7 Ns (Highest among available motors)
- **Max Thrust**: 6,395.5 N (Provides substantial initial thrust)
- **Burn Time**: 5.2 seconds
- **Isp**: 222 s (Highest efficiency)

**Rationale**: The **CesaroniO5800** offers the highest total impulse and specific impulse, ensuring the rocket has ample thrust and fuel efficiency to reach the target apogee. While it is one of the more expensive options, its performance benefits are critical for achieving the desired altitude.

### **2. Structural Design**

#### **Rocket Body**

- **Motor Radius**: 150 mm (0.15 meters) from **CesaroniO5800**
- **Minimum Body Radius**: Must be greater than motor radius. We'll choose **0.17 meters** for structural integrity and payload accommodation.

#### **Body Length**

- **Motor Length**: 754 mm (0.754 meters)
- **Additional Components**: Nose cone, payload, parachute compartment
- **Chosen Length**: **1.3 meters**

#### **Material Selection**

- **Available Materials**: aluminum, composite, fiberglass, carbon_fiber, balsa_wood, plywood, ABS_plastic
- **Chosen Material**: **Carbon Fiber**

**Rationale**: Carbon fiber offers an excellent strength-to-weight ratio, crucial for maintaining a lightweight structure while ensuring robustness against aerodynamic forces during flight. Although it is costlier than alternatives like fiberglass or balsa wood, its superior performance justifies the investment for this high-performance application.

#### **Wall Thickness**

- **Chosen Thickness**: **0.006 meters (6 mm)**

**Rationale**: A thickness of 6 mm provides a balance between structural strength and weight minimization. It ensures the rocket body can withstand the stresses encountered during launch and flight without adding unnecessary mass.

#### **Mass Calculation (Approximate)**

- **Surface Area (A)**: 
  \[
  A = 2\pi r l = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.17 \times 1.3 \approx 1.392 \, \text{m}²
  \]
- **Volume (V)**:
  \[
  V = A \times \text{thickness} = 1.392 \times 0.006 \approx 0.00835 \, \text{m}³
  \]
- **Density of Carbon Fiber**: ~1,600 kg/m³
- **Mass (m)**:
  \[
  m = V \times \text{density} = 0.00835 \times 1600 \approx 13.36 \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Total Rocket Mass**:
  \[
  \text{Body} + \text{Motor} + \text{Payload} = 13.36 + 12.418 + 0.5 \approx 26.278 \, \text{kg}
  \]

### **3. Aerodynamics**

#### **Nose Cone**

- **Shape**: **Conical**
- **Length**: **0.3 meters**
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**

**Rationale**: A conical nose cone is straightforward to manufacture and provides adequate aerodynamic performance by minimizing drag. Its shape ensures smooth airflow over the rocket body, enhancing efficiency during ascent.

#### **Fins**

- **Number of Fins**: **4**
- **Root Chord**: **0.15 meters**
- **Tip Chord**: **0.08 meters**
- **Span**: **0.3 meters**
- **Cant Angle**: **0 degrees** (no sweep)
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**
- **Thickness**: **0.006 meters (6 mm)**

**Rationale**: Four fins provide stability during flight, ensuring the rocket maintains its trajectory. Carbon fiber fins are lightweight yet strong, reducing overall mass while maintaining structural integrity.

#### **Tail**

- **Length**: **0.5 meters**
- **Top Radius**: **0.04 meters**
- **Bottom Radius**: **0.05 meters** (different from top radius)
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**

**Rationale**: Tapering the tail with different top and bottom radii prevents structural issues and aids in aerodynamic stability. Carbon fiber ensures the tail is both lightweight and robust.

---

### **4. Parachute Specifications**

**Objective**: Ensure the rocket lands safely with an impact velocity of less than 5 m/s.

#### **Impact Velocity Calculation**

Using the drag equation for steady-state descent:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho A C_d}}
\]
Where:
- \( m \) = total mass = 26.278 kg
- \( g \) = 9.81 m/s²
- \( \rho \) = air density ≈ 1.225 kg/m³
- \( A \) = total drag area
- \( C_d \) = drag coefficient ≈ 1 (assumed)

Rearranging to solve for \( A \):
\[
A = \frac{2mg}{\rho v^2 C_d} = \frac{2 \times 26.278 \times 9.81}{1.225 \times 5^2 \times 1} \approx \frac{514.278}{30.625} \approx 16.8 \, \text{m}²
\]

**Parachute Allocation**:
- **Main Parachute**: **12 m²**
- **Drogue Parachute**: **4.8 m²**
- **Total Drag Area**: **16.8 m²**

**Rationale**: Allocating sufficient drag area ensures that the descent velocity remains below the safety threshold. The combination of main and drogue parachutes provides both deceleration and stability during descent.

#### **Parachute Configuration**

##### **Main Parachute**

- **Name**: "Main"
- **cd_s**: **12.0 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate**: **105 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

##### **Drogue Parachute**

- **Name**: "Drogue"
- **cd_s**: **4.8 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate**: **105 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

---

### **5. Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length**: **1.5 meters**
- **Inclination**: **90 degrees** (vertical launch)
- **Heading**: **0 degrees** (upward direction)

**Rationale**: A vertical launch minimizes horizontal drift caused by wind, ensuring the rocket lands close to the launch site. A longer rail provides enhanced stability during the initial thrust phase.

#### **Wind Consideration**

With wind coming from the east at 5 m/s, maintaining a vertical launch (heading at 0 degrees) ensures that any drift due to wind is primarily in the east direction. Given the robust parachute system, horizontal drift will be minimal, keeping the landing site within an acceptable range.

---

### **6. Payload Specifications**

- **Mass**: **0.5 kg**
- **Position**: **0.65 meters** relative to rocket center

**Rationale**: Keeping the payload lightweight minimizes additional mass, contributing to a higher apogee. Proper positioning ensures balanced weight distribution, enhancing flight stability.

---

### **7. Cost Considerations**

- **Material Choice**: Utilizing carbon fiber for critical components (body, fins, nose cone) increases cost but is essential for achieving the desired performance and structural integrity.
- **Motor Choice**: **CesaroniO5800** is the most expensive motor but provides the necessary total impulse and thrust.
- **Parachute Size**: Larger parachutes increase cost but are necessary for safe landing velocities.
- **Overall Cost Optimization**: Balancing component quality with necessity ensures that the rocket meets performance requirements without excessive spending.

**Estimated Cost Breakdown**:
- **Motor (CesaroniO5800)**: ~$3,000
- **Carbon Fiber Components**: ~$2,500
- **Parachutes and Recovery System**: ~$500
- **Miscellaneous (adapters, launch rail, etc.)**: ~$500
- **Total Estimated Cost**: **$6,500**

**Rationale**: While the total cost is on the higher side, the selection of high-performance components is justified to meet the stringent requirements of apogee, structural integrity, and safe landing.
