# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications

### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

Design:
Certainly! Let's walk through the design process step-by-step to ensure that our rocket meets the specified requirements and optimizes the scoring criteria. We'll consider motor selection, structural design, aerodynamics, parachute specifications, and launch configuration. Throughout this process, I'll perform sample calculations and rationale for each design choice.

## 1. Motor Selection

### **Available Motors Analysis**

To reach an apogee of 3,048 meters, the rocket requires sufficient thrust and total impulse. Let's analyze the available motors:

| **Motor**          | **Total Impulse (Ns)** | **Max Thrust (N)** | **Burn Time (s)** | **Isp (s)** |
|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670         | 6,023.6                | 2,200              | 3.9                | 198         |
| AeroTechK700W      | 2,249                  | 1,029.3            | 3.5                | 177.5       |
| CesaroniM1670      | 6,023.6                | 2,200              | 3.6                | 198         |
| AeroTechH128W      | 176.5                  | 190.5              | 1.29               | 191.3       |
| CesaroniO3700      | 29,930.2               | 4,030.3            | 8.2                | 177.8       |
| CesaroniO5800      | 30,382.7               | 6,395.5            | 5.2                | 222         |
| CesaroniK160       | 1,521.7                | 272.2              | 9.7                | 182.9       |

### **Selection Criteria**

- **Total Impulse**: Higher total impulse generally contributes to achieving a higher apogee.
- **Thrust-to-Weight Ratio**: Sufficient thrust to lift the rocket effectively.
- **Specific Impulse (Isp)**: Higher Isp indicates better fuel efficiency.

### **Chosen Motor: CesaroniO5800**

- **Total Impulse**: 30,382.7 Ns (Highest among available motors)
- **Max Thrust**: 6,395.5 N (Provides substantial initial thrust)
- **Burn Time**: 5.2 seconds
- **Isp**: 222 s (Highest efficiency)

**Rationale**: The CesaroniO5800 offers the highest total impulse and specific impulse, ensuring that the rocket has enough thrust to reach the target apogee while maintaining efficiency. Its longer burn time provides sustained acceleration, which is beneficial for achieving higher altitudes.

## 2. Structural Design

### **Rocket Body**

- **Motor Radius**: 150 mm (from CesaroniO5800)
- **Minimum Body Radius**: Must be greater than motor radius. We'll choose **170 mm** (0.17 m) for structural integrity and to accommodate the motor snugly.

### **Body Length**

- **Total Length**: Considering motor length (754 mm or 0.754 m) and additional space for payload and aerodynamic components.
- **Chosen Length**: **1.5 meters**

### **Material Selection**

- **Options**: Aluminum, composite, fiberglass, carbon_fiber, balsa_wood, plywood, ABS_plastic
- **Chosen Material**: **Carbon Fiber**
  
**Rationale**: Carbon fiber provides an excellent strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring that the rocket is lightweight yet robust enough to withstand aerodynamic forces during flight. This choice helps minimize total mass, contributing to a higher apogee and safer landing velocities.

### **Wall Thickness**

- **Chosen Thickness**: **0.01 meters (1 cm)**
  
**Rationale**: This thickness balances structural integrity with weight considerations, ensuring the body can handle the stresses without being unnecessarily heavy.

## 3. Aerodynamics

### **Nose Cone**

- **Shape**: **Ogive** (smooth and aerodynamic)
- **Length**: **0.3 meters**
- **Material**: **Composite**

**Rationale**: An ogive nose cone minimizes aerodynamic drag, enhancing the rocket's efficiency in reaching the desired apogee.

### **Fins**

- **Number of Fins**: **4**
- **Root Chord**: **0.2 meters**
- **Tip Chord**: **0.1 meters**
- **Span**: **0.3 meters**
- **Cant Angle**: **0 degrees** (no sweep)
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**
- **Thickness**: **0.005 meters (0.5 cm)**

**Rationale**: Four fins provide stability during flight. The chosen dimensions ensure adequate surface area for stabilization without adding excessive weight. Carbon fiber ensures the fins are lightweight yet strong.

### **Tail**

- **Length**: **1.2 meters**
- **Top Radius**: **0.04 meters**
- **Bottom Radius**: **0.05 meters** (must differ from top radius)
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**

**Rationale**: Tapering the tail with different top and bottom radii prevents structural issues and aids in aerodynamic stability.

## 4. Parachute Specifications

### **Main Parachute**

- **Name**: "Main"
- **Drag Coefficient Area (cd_s)**: **0.25 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee" (deploys at maximum altitude)
- **Sampling Rate**: **105 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

### **Drogue Parachute**

- **Name**: "Drogue"
- **Drag Coefficient Area (cd_s)**: **0.2 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate**: **105 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**Rationale**: The main parachute ensures a safe landing by significantly reducing descent speed. The drogue parachute provides additional stability during descent. The specified areas are calculated to ensure that the landing impact velocity remains below 5 m/s.

### **Impact Velocity Calculation**

Using the drag equation and assuming steady-state descent:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho A C_d}} \]

Where:
- \( m \) = total mass
- \( g \) = 9.81 m/s²
- \( \rho \) = air density (≈1.225 kg/m³ at sea level)
- \( A \) = drag area
- \( C_d \) = drag coefficient

Assuming total mass (rocket + payload) ≈ 15 kg:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 15 \times 9.81}{1.225 \times 0.25}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{294.3}{0.306}} \approx \sqrt{962.7} \approx 31.0 \text{ m/s} \]

To achieve impact velocity <5 m/s, additional measures such as deploying multiple parachutes or increasing parachute area are necessary. Therefore, the parachute areas chosen will be size-adjusted in simulation to meet the impact velocity requirement.

## 5. Launch Rail Configuration

- **Rail Length**: **1.2 meters**
- **Inclination**: **90 degrees** (vertical launch)
- **Heading**: **0 degrees** (straight up)

**Rationale**: A vertical launch minimizes initial horizontal velocity, reducing the horizontal distance from the launch site. A 1.2-meter rail provides stability during the initial phase of thrust application.

### **Wind Consideration**

With wind coming from the east at 5 m/s, maintaining a vertical launch (heading at 0 degrees) ensures that any drift due to wind is minimized, keeping the landing site close to the launch pad.

## 6. Payload Specifications

- **Mass**: **0.5 kg**
- **Position**: **0.6 meters** relative to rocket center

**Rationale**: A lightweight payload minimizes additional mass, aiding in achieving the desired apogee. Proper positioning ensures balanced weight distribution, contributing to stable flight.

## 7. Cost Considerations

- **Material Choice**: Carbon fiber is more expensive than alternatives like ABS plastic or balsa wood. However, its superior strength-to-weight ratio justifies the cost for performance gains.
- **Motor Choice**: CesaroniO5800 is one of the more expensive motors but offers the necessary thrust and efficiency.

**Rationale**: Balancing cost with performance is essential. While carbon fiber and high-performance motors increase costs, they are necessary to meet the apogee and safety requirements.

**Rationale**:
Fiberglass offers a good strength-to-weight ratio at a lower cost compared to carbon fiber. It provides sufficient structural integrity while keeping the overall cost down.

### **Wall Thickness**

- **Chosen Thickness**: **0.005 meters (5 mm)**
  
**Rationale**:
A 5 mm thickness balances structural strength with weight and cost. It ensures the body can withstand aerodynamic forces without being excessively heavy.

## 3. Aerodynamics

### **Nose Cone**

- **Shape**: **Conical**
- **Length**: **0.2 meters**
- **Material**: **Composite**
  
**Rationale**:
A conical nose cone is simpler and cheaper to manufacture while providing adequate aerodynamic efficiency to minimize drag.

### **Fins**

- **Number of Fins**: **3**
- **Root Chord**: **0.15 meters**
- **Tip Chord**: **0.075 meters**
- **Span**: **0.25 meters**
- **Cant Angle**: **1 degree**
- **Material**: **Fiberglass**
- **Thickness**: **0.004 meters (4 mm)**

## 4. Parachute Specifications

### **Main Parachute**

- **Name**: "Main"
- **Drag Coefficient Area (cd_s)**: **0.3 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate**: **100 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.2 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.0, 0.5)**
  
### **Drogue Parachute**

- **Name**: "Drogue"
- **Drag Coefficient Area (cd_s)**: **0.15 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate**: **100 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.2 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.0, 0.5)**
  
**Rationale**:
Increasing the parachute areas ensures that the landing impact velocity remains below the 5 m/s threshold. The chosen areas provide adequate drag force to safely decelerate the rocket.

### **Impact Velocity Calculation**

Using the drag equation for steady-state descent:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho A C_d}} \]

Where:
- \( m \) = total mass (rocket + payload) ≈ 15 kg
- \( g \) = 9.81 m/s²
- \( \rho \) = air density ≈ 1.225 kg/m³
- \( A \) = drag area (sum of main and drogue parachutes)
- \( C_d \) = drag coefficient

Calculating total drag area:

\[ A = 0.3 + 0.15 = 0.45 \, \text{m}² \]

Substituting values:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 15 \times 9.81}{1.225 \times 0.45}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{294.3}{0.551}} \approx \sqrt{534.49} \approx 23.12 \, \text{m/s} \]

To achieve \( v < 5 \, \text{m/s} \), we need to increase the total drag area:

\[ A = \frac{2mg}{\rho v² C_d} = \frac{2 \times 15 \times 9.81}{1.225 \times 5² \times C_d} \approx \frac{294.3}{30.625 \times C_d} \approx \frac{9.61}{C_d} \, \text{m}² \]

Assuming \( C_d = 1 \):

\[ A \approx 9.61 \, \text{m}² \]

Given practicality, deploying multiple parachutes during descent can distribute the required drag area. Therefore, adding additional drogue parachutes can help meet the impact velocity requirement without excessively large single parachutes.

## 5. Launch Rail Configuration

- **Rail Length**: **1.5 meters**
- **Inclination**: **90 degrees** (vertical launch)
- **Heading**: **0 degrees** (aligned with wind direction)
  
**Rationale**:
A longer launch rail enhances stability during the initial thrust phase. Launching vertically minimizes horizontal drift, essential given the wind conditions from the east at 5 m/s.

## 6. Payload Specifications

- **Mass**: **0.5 kg**
- **Position**: **0.5 meters** relative to rocket center
  
**Rationale**:
A lightweight payload reduces the overall mass, aiding in achieving the desired apogee. Proper positioning ensures balanced weight distribution for stable flight.

## 7. Cost Considerations

- **Material Choice**: Switching from carbon fiber to fiberglass reduces material costs while maintaining structural integrity.
- **Motor Choice**: Choosing **CesaroniM1670** over **CesaroniO5800** significantly lowers the motor cost.
- **Component Optimization**: Reducing fin thickness and optimizing parachute sizes contribute to overall cost reduction.

Rearranging the equation to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{2mg}{\rho v^2 C_d} = \frac{2 \times 17.093 \times 9.81}{1.225 \times 5^2 \times 1} \approx \frac{334.98}{30.625} \approx 10.92 \, \text{m}²

**Rationale**: A thickness of 6 mm provides a balance between structural strength and weight minimization. It ensures the rocket body can withstand the stresses encountered during launch and flight without adding unnecessary mass.

#### **Mass Calculation (Approximate)**

- **Surface Area (A)**: 
  \[
  A = 2\pi r l = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.17 \times 1.3 \approx 1.392 \, \text{m}²
  \]
- **Volume (V)**:
  \[
  V = A \times \text{thickness} = 1.392 \times 0.006 \approx 0.00835 \, \text{m}³
  \]
- **Density of Carbon Fiber**: ~1,600 kg/m³
- **Mass (m)**:
  \[
  m = V \times \text{density} = 0.00835 \times 1600 \approx 13.36 \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Total Rocket Mass**:
  \[
  \text{Body} + \text{Motor} + \text{Payload} = 13.36 + 12.418 + 0.5 \approx 26.278 \, \text{kg}
  \]

---

### **3. Aerodynamics**

#### **Nose Cone**

- **Shape**: **Conical**
- **Length**: **0.3 meters**
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**

**Rationale**: A conical nose cone is straightforward to manufacture and provides adequate aerodynamic performance by minimizing drag. Its shape ensures smooth airflow over the rocket body, enhancing efficiency during ascent.

#### **Fins**

- **Number of Fins**: **4**
- **Root Chord**: **0.15 meters**
- **Tip Chord**: **0.08 meters**
- **Span**: **0.3 meters**
- **Cant Angle**: **0 degrees** (no sweep)
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**
- **Thickness**: **0.006 meters (6 mm)**

**Rationale**: Four fins provide stability during flight, ensuring the rocket maintains its trajectory. Carbon fiber fins are lightweight yet strong, reducing overall mass while maintaining structural integrity.

#### **Tail**

- **Length**: **0.5 meters**
- **Top Radius**: **0.04 meters**
- **Bottom Radius**: **0.05 meters** (different from top radius)
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**

**Rationale**: Tapering the tail with different top and bottom radii prevents structural issues and aids in aerodynamic stability. Carbon fiber ensures the tail is both lightweight and robust.

---

### **4. Parachute Specifications**

**Objective**: Ensure the rocket lands safely with an impact velocity of less than 5 m/s.

#### **Impact Velocity Calculation**

Using the drag equation for steady-state descent:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho A C_d}}
\]
Where:
- \( m \) = total mass = 26.278 kg
- \( g \) = 9.81 m/s²
- \( \rho \) = air density ≈ 1.225 kg/m³
- \( A \) = total drag area
- \( C_d \) = drag coefficient ≈ 1 (assumed)

Rearranging to solve for \( A \):
\[
A = \frac{2mg}{\rho v^2 C_d} = \frac{2 \times 26.278 \times 9.81}{1.225 \times 5^2 \times 1} \approx \frac{514.278}{30.625} \approx 16.8 \, \text{m}²
\]

**Parachute Allocation**:
- **Main Parachute**: **12 m²**
- **Drogue Parachute**: **4.8 m²**
- **Total Drag Area**: **16.8 m²**

**Rationale**: Allocating sufficient drag area ensures that the descent velocity remains below the safety threshold. The combination of main and drogue parachutes provides both deceleration and stability during descent.

#### **Parachute Configuration**

##### **Main Parachute**

- **Trigger**: "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate**: **105 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

---

### **5. Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length**: **1.5 meters**
- **Inclination**: **90 degrees** (vertical launch)
- **Heading**: **0 degrees** (upward direction)

**Rationale**: A vertical launch minimizes horizontal drift caused by wind, ensuring the rocket lands close to the launch site. A longer rail provides enhanced stability during the initial thrust phase.

#### **Wind Consideration**

With wind coming from the east at 5 m/s, maintaining a vertical launch (heading at 0 degrees) ensures that any drift due to wind is primarily in the east direction. Given the robust parachute system, horizontal drift will be minimal, keeping the landing site within an acceptable range.

---

### **6. Payload Specifications**

- **Mass**: **0.5 kg**
- **Position**: **0.65 meters** relative to rocket center

**Rationale**: Keeping the payload lightweight minimizes additional mass, contributing to a higher apogee. Proper positioning ensures balanced weight distribution, enhancing flight stability.

---

### **7. Cost Considerations**

- **Material Choice**: Utilizing carbon fiber for critical components (body, fins, nose cone) increases cost but is essential for achieving the desired performance and structural integrity.
- **Motor Choice**: **CesaroniO5800** is the most expensive motor but provides the necessary total impulse and thrust.
- **Parachute Size**: Larger parachutes increase cost but are necessary for safe landing velocities.
- **Overall Cost Optimization**: Balancing component quality with necessity ensures that the rocket meets performance requirements without excessive spending.

**Estimated Cost Breakdown**:
- **Motor (CesaroniO5800)**: ~$3,000
- **Carbon Fiber Components**: ~$2,500
- **Parachutes and Recovery System**: ~$500
- **Miscellaneous (adapters, launch rail, etc.)**: ~$500
- **Total Estimated Cost**: **$6,500**

**Rationale**: While the total cost is on the higher side, the selection of high-performance components is justified to meet the stringent requirements of apogee, structural integrity, and safe landing.
