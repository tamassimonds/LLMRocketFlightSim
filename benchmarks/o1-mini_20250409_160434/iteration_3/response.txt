## 2. Structural Design

### **Rocket Body**

- **Motor Radius**: 161 mm (0.161 meters) from CesaroniO3700.
- **Minimum Body Radius**: Must be greater than the motor radius. We'll choose **0.18 meters** to ensure structural integrity and accommodate the motor.

### **Body Length**

- **Motor Length**: 0.957 meters.
- **Additional Space**: For payload, nose cone, and aerodynamic components.
- **Chosen Length**: **1.5 meters**.

### **Material Selection**

- **Available Options**: Aluminum, composite, fiberglass, carbon_fiber, balsa_wood, plywood, ABS_plastic.
- **Chosen Material**: **Balsa Wood**.

**Rationale**:

- **Weight Efficiency**: Balsa wood offers a superior strength-to-weight ratio, minimizing the overall mass of the rocket.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Balsa wood is generally more affordable compared to materials like carbon fiber or fiberglass.
- **Structural Integrity**: Properly designed balsa wood structures can withstand aerodynamic forces during flight.

### **Wall Thickness**

- **Chosen Thickness**: **7 mm (0.007 meters)**.

**Rationale**:

- **Balance**: A thickness of 7 mm provides sufficient strength while keeping the mass low.
- **Compatibility**: Compatible with the chosen motor and ensures the body can handle stress without being overly heavy.

### **Mass Calculation**

- **Surface Area**: 
  \[
  A = 2\pi r l = 2 \times 3.14 \times 0.18 \times 1.5 \approx 1.696 \, \text{m}²
  \]
- **Volume**:
  \[
  V = A \times \text{thickness} = 1.696 \times 0.007 \approx 0.011872 \, \text{m}³
  \]
- **Density of Balsa Wood**: ~160 kg/m³
- **Mass**:
  \[
  m = V \times \text{density} = 0.011872 \times 160 \approx 1.899 \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Total Rocket Mass**:
  \[
  \text{Body} + \text{Motor} + \text{Payload} = 1.899 + 14.194 + 1 \approx 17.093 \, \text{kg}
  \]

## 3. Aerodynamics

### **Nose Cone**

- **Shape**: **Conical**
- **Length**: **0.3 meters**
- **Material**: **Composite**

**Rationale**:

- **Simplicity**: Conical nose cones are easier and cheaper to manufacture compared to more complex shapes like ogive.
- **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Provides adequate aerodynamic performance to minimize drag.

### **Fins**

- **Number of Fins**: **3**
- **Root Chord**: **0.15 meters**
- **Tip Chord**: **0.075 meters**
- **Span**: **0.25 meters**
- **Cant Angle**: **1 degree**
- **Material**: **Composite**
- **Thickness**: **5 mm (0.005 meters)**

**Rationale**:

- **Stability**: Three fins provide sufficient stability while reducing material usage and weight compared to four fins.
- **Aerodynamics**: The slight cant angle enhances aerodynamic stability without complicating the design.
- **Weight & Cost**: Using composite ensures the fins are lightweight yet strong.

### **Tail**

- **Length**: **0.5 meters**
- **Top Radius**: **0.04 meters**
- **Bottom Radius**: **0.05 meters**
- **Material**: **Composite**

**Rationale**:

- **Aerodynamic Balance**: Tapering the tail with different top and bottom radii prevents structural issues and aids in aerodynamic stability.
- **Strength**: Composite material ensures durability during descent and landing.

## 4. Parachute Specifications

### **Impact Velocity Calculation**

To ensure a safe landing with an impact velocity of less than 5 m/s, we use the drag equation:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho A C_d}}
\]

Where:
- \( m \) = total mass = 17.093 kg
- \( g \) = 9.81 m/s²
- \( \rho \) = air density ≈ 1.225 kg/m³
- \( A \) = total drag area
- \( C_d \) = drag coefficient ≈ 1 (assumed for simplicity)

Rearranging the equation to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{2mg}{\rho v^2 C_d} = \frac{2 \times 17.093 \times 9.81}{1.225 \times 5^2 \times 1} \approx \frac{334.98}{30.625} \approx 10.92 \, \text{m}²
\]

**Parachute Allocation**:
- **Main Parachute**: **7 m²**
- **Drogue Parachute**: **3 m²**
- **Total Drag Area**: **10 m²**

### **Parachute Configuration**

#### **Main Parachute**
- **Name**: "Main"
- **Drag Coefficient Area (cd_s)**: **7.0 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate**: **105 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

#### **Drogue Parachute**
- **Name**: "Drogue"
- **Drag Coefficient Area (cd_s)**: **3.0 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate**: **105 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**Rationale**:

- **Safety**: The combined drag area ensures the impact velocity remains below 5 m/s.
- **Reliability**: Deploying both main and drogue parachutes provides redundancy and stability during descent.

---

## 5. Launch Rail Configuration

- **Rail Length**: **1.2 meters**
- **Inclination**: **90 degrees** (vertical launch)
- **Heading**: **0 degrees** (aligned straight up)

**Rationale**:

- **Stability**: A 1.2-meter launch rail provides sufficient support during the initial thrust phase.
- **Minimized Drift**: Vertical launch minimizes horizontal drift caused by wind, keeping the landing site close to the launch pad.

---

## 6. Payload Specifications

- **Mass**: **1.0 kg**
- **Position**: **0.7 meters** relative to the rocket center

**Rationale**:

- **Weight Efficiency**: A lightweight payload reduces the overall mass, aiding in achieving the desired apogee.
- **Balance**: Proper positioning ensures balanced weight distribution, contributing to stable flight dynamics.

---

## 7. Cost Considerations

- **Material Choice**: 
  - **Balsa Wood**: Offers a lightweight and cost-effective solution compared to carbon fiber and fiberglass.
  - **Composite for Nose Cone and Fins**: Balances cost with necessary structural integrity.
  
- **Motor Choice**: 
  - **CesaroniO3700**: Selected for its high total impulse and presumed cost efficiency compared to the O5800.
  
- **Parachutes**: 
  - **Larger Drag Areas**: Invest in adequately sized parachutes to ensure safe landing velocities, which potentially reduces the need for more expensive recovery systems.

- **Overall Cost Optimization**:
  - By selecting materials like balsa wood and optimizing component sizes, the overall cost is kept in check without compromising on performance or safety.
