## 2. Structural Design

### **Rocket Body**

- **Motor Radius**: **75 mm (0.075 meters)** from **Pro75M1670**
- **Minimum Body Radius**: Must be greater than motor radius. We'll choose **0.09 meters (90 mm)** to ensure structural integrity and accommodate the motor snugly.

### **Body Length**

- **Motor Length**: **757 mm (0.757 meters)**
- **Additional Components**: Space for payload, nose cone, and aerodynamic structures.
- **Chosen Length**: **1.2 meters**

### **Material Selection**

- **Available Materials**: aluminum, composite, fiberglass, carbon_fiber, balsa_wood, plywood, ABS_plastic
- **Chosen Material**: **Balsa Wood**

**Rationale**:

- **Weight Efficiency**: Balsa wood offers a superior strength-to-weight ratio, minimizing the overall mass of the rocket.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: It is more affordable compared to materials like carbon fiber or fiberglass.
- **Structural Integrity**: Properly designed balsa wood structures can withstand aerodynamic forces during flight.

### **Wall Thickness**

- **Chosen Thickness**: **0.005 meters (5 mm)**

**Rationale**:

- **Balance**: A thickness of 5 mm provides sufficient strength while keeping the mass low.
- **Compatibility**: Ensures that the body can handle stress without being overly heavy.

### **Mass Calculation (Approximate)**

- **Surface Area (A)**: 
  \[
  A = 2\pi r l = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.09 \times 1.2 \approx 0.678 \, \text{m}²
  \]
  
- **Volume (V)**:
  \[
  V = A \times \text{thickness} = 0.678 \times 0.005 \approx 0.00339 \, \text{m}³
  \]
  
- **Density of Balsa Wood**: ~160 kg/m³
- **Mass (m)**:
  \[
  m = V \times \text{density} = 0.00339 \times 160 \approx 0.542 \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Total Rocket Mass**:
  \[
  \text{Body} + \text{Motor} + \text{Payload} = 0.542 + 1.815 + 0.5 \approx 2.857 \, \text{kg}
  \]

*Note*: This mass calculation excludes fins and other minor components, which will add additional mass. However, for initial design purposes, this provides a baseline.

## 3. Aerodynamics

### **Nose Cone**

- **Shape**: **Conical**
- **Length**: **0.2 meters**
- **Material**: **Balsa Wood**

**Rationale**:

- **Simplicity**: Conical nose cones are straightforward to manufacture.
- **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Provides adequate aerodynamic performance by minimizing drag, ensuring smooth airflow over the rocket body.

### **Fins**

- **Number of Fins**: **3**
- **Root Chord**: **0.1 meters**
- **Tip Chord**: **0.05 meters**
- **Span**: **0.2 meters**
- **Cant Angle**: **0 degrees** (no sweep)
- **Material**: **Fiberglass**
- **Thickness**: **0.003 meters (3 mm)**

**Rationale**:

- **Stability**: Three fins provide sufficient stability during flight while reducing material usage and mass compared to four fins.
- **Weight & Cost**: Using fiberglass offers a good balance between strength and weight while keeping costs low.
- **Aerodynamics**: Proper chord and span dimensions ensure sufficient surface area for stabilization without excessive drag.

### **Tail**

- **Length**: **0.3 meters**
- **Top Radius**: **0.03 meters**
- **Bottom Radius**: **0.035 meters** (different from top radius)
- **Material**: **Balsa Wood**

**Rationale**:

- **Aerodynamic Balance**: Tapering the tail with different top and bottom radii prevents structural issues and aids in aerodynamic stability.
- **Weight Efficiency**: Balsa wood ensures the tail is lightweight yet durable.

## 4. Parachute Specifications

### **Impact Velocity Calculation**

To ensure a safe landing with an impact velocity of less than **5 m/s**, we use the drag equation:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho A C_d}}
\]

Where:
- \( m \) = total mass = **2.857 kg**
- \( g \) = 9.81 m/s²
- \( \rho \) = air density ≈ 1.225 kg/m³
- \( A \) = total drag area
- \( C_d \) = drag coefficient ≈ 1 (assumed for simplicity)

Rearranging to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{2mg}{\rho v^2 C_d} = \frac{2 \times 2.857 \times 9.81}{1.225 \times 25 \times 1} \approx \frac{56.1}{30.625} \approx 1.83 \, \text{m}²
\]

**Parachute Allocation:**
- **Main Parachute**: **1.5 m²**
- **Drogue Parachute**: **0.7 m²**
- **Total Drag Area**: **2.2 m²**

**Rationale**:

- **Safety**: Allocating a total drag area of 2.2 m² ensures that the impact velocity remains below the 5 m/s threshold.
- **Redundancy**: Deploying both main and drogue parachutes provides additional stability during descent.
- **Practicality**: The chosen sizes are manageable and feasible within the design constraints.

### **Parachute Configuration**

#### **Main Parachute**

- **Name**: "Main"
- **cd_s**: **1.5 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee" (deploys at maximum altitude)
- **Sampling Rate**: **105 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

#### **Drogue Parachute**

- **Name**: "Drogue"
- **cd_s**: **0.7 m²**
- **Trigger**: "apogee"
- **Sampling Rate**: **105 Hz**
- **Lag**: **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise**: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

---

## 5. Launch Rail Configuration

- **Rail Length**: **1.0 meters**
- **Inclination**: **90 degrees** (vertical launch)
- **Heading**: **0 degrees** (straight up)

**Rationale**:

- **Stability**: A 1.0-meter rail provides sufficient support during the initial thrust phase.
- **Minimized Drift**: Vertical launch minimizes horizontal drift caused by wind, ensuring the landing site remains close to the launch pad.
- **Wind Consideration**: With wind coming from the east at 5 m/s, maintaining a vertical launch orientation helps mitigate the effects of wind on landing displacement.

---

## 6. Payload Specifications

- **Mass**: **0.5 kg**
- **Position**: **0.6 meters** relative to rocket center

**Rationale**:

- **Weight Efficiency**: Keeping the payload lightweight minimizes additional mass, aiding in achieving the desired apogee.
- **Balance**: Proper positioning ensures balanced weight distribution, enhancing flight stability.

---

## 7. Cost Considerations

- **Material Choice**:
  - **Balsa Wood**: Chosen for the body and tail to minimize weight and cost while maintaining structural integrity.
  - **Fiberglass**: Used for fins to provide adequate strength without excessive weight or cost.
  
- **Motor Choice**:
  - **Pro75M1670**: Selected for its high specific impulse (198 s) and substantial total impulse (6,023.6 Ns) while maintaining a lower dry mass (1.815 kg), balancing performance and overall rocket mass.
  
- **Parachutes**:
  - **Main and Drogue**: Appropriately sized to ensure safe landing velocities without incurring unnecessary costs.
  
- **Overall Cost Optimization**:
  - By selecting cost-effective materials like balsa wood and fiberglass, and opting for a motor that offers a good balance between performance and mass, the overall cost is kept manageable.

**Estimated Cost Breakdown**:
- **Motor (Pro75M1670)**: ~$800
- **Balsa Wood Components**: ~$150
- **Fiberglass Fins**: ~$100
- **Parachutes and Recovery System**: ~$100
- **Miscellaneous (adapters, launch rail, etc.)**: ~$100
- **Total Estimated Cost**: **$1,250**

**Rationale**:

- **Material Efficiency**: Utilizing balsa wood and fiberglass reduces material costs while maintaining necessary strength and durability.
- **Motor Investment**: The Pro75M1670 is a significant cost but offers crucial performance benefits for achieving the target apogee.
- **Parachute Allocation**: Ensuring sufficient drag area without overspending on excessively large parachutes.
- **Miscellaneous Costs**: Includes essential components like adapters and launch rail to ensure smooth operation.

*Note*: Although the total cost slightly exceeds the **max_cost** threshold of **$1,000** in the scoring function, this design prioritizes achieving the target apogee and safe landing, which are critical for a successful mission. Future iterations could explore cost-reduction strategies, such as using alternative materials or optimizing component sizes further.
