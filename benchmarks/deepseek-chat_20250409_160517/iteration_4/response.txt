After analyzing the previous attempts, I'll design an improved rocket that better balances impulse, weight, and cost to achieve the target apogee. Here's my reasoning and optimized design:

### Key Learnings from Previous Attempts:
1. **Impulse Requirements**:
   - 6023.6 Ns (M1670 motors) reached ~2700-2800m (9-22% short)
   - Need ~15-20% more impulse for 3048m target
   - Next available option: AeroTechK700W (2249 Ns) is too small
   - Must optimize current motor performance

2. **Weight Optimization**:
   - Previous designs were either too heavy (Attempt 2) or slightly underpowered
   - Need to reduce dry mass while maintaining structure

3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**:
   - Von Karman nose performed better than ogive
   - Fin sizing needs careful balance between stability and drag

### Improved Design Strategy:
1. **Motor Selection**:
   - Stick with CesaroniM1670 (6023.6 Ns)
   - Compensate for impulse deficit with:
     - Reduced airframe weight
     - Improved aerodynamics
     - Optimized mass distribution

2. **Structural Optimization**:
   - Thinner walls where possible
   - Lighter materials for non-critical components
   - Shorter overall length to reduce weight

3. **Aerodynamic Improvements**:
   - More aggressive nose cone (LV-Haack for minimum drag)
   - Smaller, more efficient fins
   - Better fin cant angle for wind compensation

4. **Recovery System**:
   - Larger main chute for safer landing
   - Smaller drogue to limit drift

### Calculations:
- Estimated total mass: ~4.5kg (motor 3.1kg + structure 0.7kg + payload 0.7kg)
- Thrust-to-weight: 1533.9N/(4.5kg*9.81) ≈ 35
- Expected altitude: ~3000m (with improved efficiency)
- Landing speed: ~4.5 m/s (with 0.3 cd_s main)

### Final Optimized Design:

```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Material Upgrade**: Carbon fiber body for strength-to-weight ratio
2. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - LV-Haack nose cone (minimum drag)
   - 3 fins instead of 4 (reduced drag)
   - Increased cant angle (1°) for better wind stability
3. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Thinner walls (3.5mm)
   - Shorter body (1.3m)
4. **Recovery System**:
   - Larger main chute (0.3 cd_s) for safer landing
   - Maintained drogue size to limit drift
5. **Cost Control**:
   - Despite carbon fiber, reduced material amounts keep cost reasonable
   - Estimated cost: ~$800-900

This design should:
- Reach closer to 3048m through improved efficiency
- Maintain structural integrity
- Land safely (<5 m/s)
- Minimize horizontal drift
- Stay within reasonable cost parameters

The combination of aerodynamic improvements and weight reduction should compensate for the slight impulse deficit from the M1670 motor, while the recovery system ensures safe landing and minimal drift.
