After carefully analyzing all previous attempts, I'll design an optimized rocket that achieves the closest possible apogee to 3048m while maintaining safety and cost efficiency. Here's my improved design with rationale:

### Key Insights from Previous Attempts:
1. Best performance came from Attempt 5 (2859m) using Pro75M1670
2. Need ~6% more altitude to reach target (from 2859m to 3048m)
3. Carbon fiber construction proved effective for weight savings
4. Von Karman nose and 3-fin configuration worked well
5. Current design lands safely and maintains structural integrity

### Optimized Design Strategy:
1. **Motor Selection**: Stick with Pro75M1670 (best balance of impulse and weight)
2. **Aerodynamic Improvements**:
   - Slightly longer nose cone (0.5m) for better drag reduction
   - Adjust fin dimensions to optimize stability vs drag
3. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Minimize non-essential mass
   - Optimize payload position
4. **Recovery System**:
   - Fine-tune parachute sizes for optimal descent

### Final Optimized Design:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "Pro75M1670",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.08,
        "length": 1.35,
        "material": "carbon_fiber",
        "thickness": 0.0028,  # Slightly thinner possible with carbon fiber
    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {
            "kind": "von karman",
            "length": 0.5,  # Increased length for better aerodynamics
            "material": "composite",
        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 3,
            "root_chord": 0.2,
            "tip_chord": 0.1,
            "span": 0.15,  # Reduced span for less drag
            "cant_angle": 1.25,  # Balanced cant angle
            "material": "carbon_fiber",
            "thickness": 0.0028,
        },
        "tail": {

            "material": "carbon_fiber",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.33,  # Optimized for safe landing
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.1,  # Smaller to limit drift
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.5,
        "inclination": 90,
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.45,  # Slightly reduced payload
        "position": 0.75,  # Optimized position
    },
}
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - Longer von Karman nose (0.5m) reduces drag
   - Smaller fin span (0.15m) decreases drag while maintaining stability
   - Balanced cant angle (1.25Â°) for wind resistance

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Thinner walls (2.8mm) possible with carbon fiber
   - Slightly reduced payload mass (0.45kg)
   - Optimized payload position for better CG

3. **Performance Boost**:
   - Expected ~4-5% altitude gain from drag reduction
   - Should reach ~3000-3100m range

4. **Safety and Cost**:
   - Maintains structural integrity
   - Lands safely (<5 m/s)
   - Cost remains reasonable (~$800-850)

### Expected Results:
- Target Apogee: 3048m
- Predicted Apogee: 3000-3100m
- Landing Velocity: ~4.5 m/s
- Horizontal Drift: Minimal
- Cost: ~$825

This design represents the optimal balance of all scoring criteria based on all previous attempts, with careful adjustments to push the apogee closer to the target while maintaining all other requirements.
