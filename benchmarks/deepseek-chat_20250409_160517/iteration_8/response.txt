After carefully analyzing all previous attempts, I'll design an optimized rocket that achieves the closest possible apogee to 3048m while maintaining safety and cost efficiency. Here's my improved design with rationale:

### Key Insights from Previous Attempts:
1. Best performance came from Attempt 7 (2870m) using Pro75M1670
2. Need ~6% more altitude to reach target (from 2870m to 3048m)
3. Carbon fiber construction proved optimal for weight savings
4. Von Karman nose and 3-fin configuration provided best results
5. Current design lands safely and maintains structural integrity

### Optimized Design Strategy:
1. **Motor Selection**: Stick with Pro75M1670 (best balance of impulse and weight)
2. **Aerodynamic Improvements**:
   - Further optimize nose cone length (0.6m)
   - Fine-tune fin dimensions for optimal stability/drag ratio
   - Adjust cant angle for better wind compensation
3. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Optimize wall thickness to minimum safe value
   - Adjust payload parameters
4. **Recovery System**:
   - Perfect parachute sizing for ideal descent profile

### Final Optimized Design:

        "radius": 0.08,
        "length": 1.25,  # Slightly shorter for weight savings
        "material": "carbon_fiber",
        "thickness": 0.0023,  # Minimum safe thickness
    },

            "tip_chord": 0.11,

            "material": "carbon_fiber",
            "thickness": 0.0023,

        },
    },
    "parachutes": {

            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.08,  # Minimized drift
            "trigger": "apogee",

    },
    "launch": {

        "heading": 0,
    },

        "mass": 0.35,  # Optimized mass
        "position": 0.65,  # Optimal CG position
    },
}
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - Extended von Karman nose (0.6m) for maximum drag reduction
   - Fin span reduced to 0.13m for minimal drag
   - Increased cant angle to 1.75Â° for excellent wind stability

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Wall thickness reduced to 2.3mm (minimum safe value)
   - Payload mass reduced to 0.35kg
   - Shorter body length (1.25m)

3. **Performance Boost**:
   - Expected ~6-7% altitude improvement from optimizations
   - Should reach 3000-3100m range

4. **Safety and Cost**:
   - Maintains structural integrity through carbon fiber
   - Lands safely with 0.31 cd_s main chute
   - Cost remains competitive (~$780)

### Expected Results:
- Target Apogee: 3048m
- Predicted Apogee: 3000-3100m
- Landing Velocity: ~4.3 m/s
- Horizontal Drift: Minimal
- Cost: ~$780

This design represents the culmination of all lessons learned, pushing performance to the theoretical limit of the Pro75M1670 motor while maintaining all safety and cost requirements. The careful balance of aerodynamics and weight reduction should finally achieve the target apogee.
