Alright, let's tackle this rocket design step by step. I'm going to think like a rocket scientist to come up with a design that meets all the requirements while optimizing for the scoring criteria.

### Understanding the Requirements

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters (10,000 feet)
2. **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from the East
3. **Scoring Criteria**:
   - Distance to max apogee (closer to 3048m is better)
   - Cost (cheaper is better)
   - Safe landing (<5 m/s impact velocity)
   - No structural failure
   - Minimal horizontal distance from launch site

### Available Motors Analysis

First, let's look at the motors available. We need one that can get us to ~3048m. Here's a quick comparison:

- **Pro75M1670**: Avg Thrust=1533.9N, Total Impulse=6023.6Ns
- **AeroTechK700W**: Avg Thrust=658.7N, Total Impulse=2249Ns
- **CesaroniM1670**: Similar to Pro75M1670
- **AeroTechH128W**: Too small (Avg Thrust=141.2N)
- **CesaroniO3700, O5800**: Very high thrust, likely overkill
- **CesaroniK160**: Low thrust (190.2N), long burn (9.7s)

For ~3000m, motors like Pro75M1670 or CesaroniM1670 seem appropriate. They have enough impulse to reach high altitudes without being excessively powerful.

**Choosing Motor**: Let's go with **Pro75M1670** because it's slightly lighter (dry mass 1.815kg vs 3.101kg) and has similar performance to CesaroniM1670.

### Rocket Body Design

**Motor Radius**: 75mm (0.075m)
**Body Radius**: Must be > motor radius. Let's choose 0.08m (80mm).

**Length**: Need enough length to house motor and payload. Motor length is 757mm (0.757m). Let's add some space for payload and recovery. Total body length: ~1.2m.

**Material**: Need something strong but not too expensive. **Fiberglass** is a good balance between strength and cost.

**Thickness**: For fiberglass, ~0.005m (5mm) should be sufficient for structural integrity.

### Nose Cone

**Shape**: "ogive" is a good compromise between aerodynamics and simplicity.
**Length**: Typically 2-3 times body radius. Let's choose 0.25m.
**Material**: "composite" for strength and lightweight.

### Fins

**Number**: 4 fins for stability.
**Dimensions**:
- Root chord: ~0.15m
- Tip chord: ~0.075m
- Span: ~0.3m
- Cant angle: 0.5 degrees for slight stability
**Material**: "carbon_fiber" for strength and lightweight.
**Thickness**: 0.005m (5mm)

### Tail

**Length**: ~0.2m
**Top radius**: 0.075m (same as motor)
**Bottom radius**: 0.08m (must be different from top)
**Material**: "carbon_fiber"

### Parachutes

Need two: main and drogue.

**Drogue**:
- Deploy at apogee
- Smaller to slow descent but not too much
- Let's choose cd_s = 0.2

**Main**:
- Larger to ensure safe landing <5 m/s
- cd_s = 0.25

### Launch Rail

**Length**: ~1.2m (similar to rocket length)
**Inclination**: 90 degrees (vertical)
**Heading**: 0 degrees (straight up, wind is from East but we'll handle drift with fins)

### Payload

Assume a small payload:
- Mass: 0.5 kg
- Position: 0.6m from center (towards nose)

### Cost Consideration

Materials:
- Fiberglass body: moderate cost
- Composite nose: moderate
- Carbon fiber fins and tail: higher cost but necessary for strength
Overall, should be within budget (<$1000)

### Sample Calculations (Approximate)

1. **Thrust-to-Weight Ratio**:
   - Motor avg thrust: 1533.9N
   - Estimated rocket mass (dry + motor + payload): ~3kg (motor dry 1.815kg + payload 0.5kg + structure ~0.7kg)
   - Weight: 3kg * 9.81 ≈ 30N
   - Thrust/Weight ≈ 1533.9/30 ≈ 51 (very high, which is good for initial acceleration)

2. **Apogee Estimation**:
   - Total impulse: 6023.6Ns
   - Rough estimate for altitude: For high-power rockets, impulse of ~6000Ns can reach ~3000m depending on drag.

3. **Landing Speed**:
   - With main chute cd_s=0.25, should be <5 m/s for safe landing.

```

### Reasoning Summary

- **Motor**: Pro75M1670 provides sufficient impulse for ~3000m without being overly powerful or heavy.
- **Body**: Sized to fit motor with some margin; fiberglass balances cost and strength.
- **Nose Cone**: Ogive shape for good aerodynamics; composite material.
- **Fins**: Carbon fiber for strength; dimensions chosen for stability.
- **Parachutes**: Sized to ensure safe landing speed.
- **Launch**: Vertical to minimize wind drift; fins will help counteract wind.
- **Cost**: Kept reasonable by avoiding overly expensive materials where not needed.

This design should achieve the target apogee, land safely, and score well on cost and other criteria.
