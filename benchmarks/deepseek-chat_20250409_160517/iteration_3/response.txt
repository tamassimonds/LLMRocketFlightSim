Let me analyze the previous attempts and design an improved solution:

Analysis of Previous Attempts:
1. Attempt 1 (Pro75M1670):
   - Underperformed by 9% (2773m vs 3048m target)
   - Good structural integrity and cost ($743)
   - Needed more impulse

2. Attempt 2 (CesaroniO3700):
   - Overcorrected with too large motor
   - Went over budget ($2272)
   - Still underperformed (2211m)
   - Too heavy, inefficient design

Key Insights:
- Need a motor between these two options
- Must balance impulse and weight
- Maintain cost-effectiveness
- Optimize aerodynamics

Improved Design Strategy:
1. Motor Selection:
   - Choose CesaroniM1670 (same impulse as Pro75M1670 but better packaging)
   - 6023.6 Ns total impulse
   - Dry mass 3.101kg (heavier than Pro75 but better for our needs)

2. Weight Optimization:
   - Lighter materials where possible
   - Smaller airframe than Attempt 2
   - Careful mass distribution

3. Aerodynamic Improvements:
   - More efficient nose cone shape
   - Optimized fin design
   - Better stability margins

4. Cost Control:
   - Use fiberglass instead of carbon fiber where possible
   - Reasonable parachute sizes

Calculations:
- Estimated total mass: ~5kg
- Thrust-to-weight: 1533.9N / (5kg*9.81) ≈ 31 (excellent)
- Expected altitude: ~3000m (based on similar rockets with this impulse)
- Landing speed: <5m/s with chosen parachutes

Final Improved Design:

}
```

Key Improvements:
1. Better motor selection - CesaroniM1670 provides same impulse as Pro75 but better packaging
2. Longer body (1.5m) for better stability
3. Von Karman nose cone for improved aerodynamics
4. Optimized fin dimensions (larger root chord, smaller span)
5. Increased cant angle (0.75°) for better stability in crosswinds
6. Adjusted parachute sizes for optimal descent
7. Slightly increased payload capacity (0.7kg)
8. Maintained reasonable cost through material choices

This design should:
- Reach closer to target apogee (3000m+)
- Maintain structural integrity
- Land safely (<5m/s)
- Stay within reasonable cost
- Minimize horizontal drift
