To improve the rocket design and better achieve the target apogee of 3048 meters, we need to make more effective choices in motor selection, material use, and overall design. Let's analyze the lessons from past attempts and lay out a strategy focusing on a balanced power-to-weight ratio, structural efficiency, and cost control.

### Design Strategy Overview

**1. Motor Selection:**
   - Previous attempts with motors like the AeroTechK700W and CesaroniM1670 showed underperformance in hitting target apogee, primarily due to insufficient thrust or impulse.
   - The **CesaroniO3700** is a powerful option with a high impulse, but it proved costly.
   - **CesaroniM1670** is a balanced choice when combined with a lighter overall design and better aerodynamics, allowing us to efficiently reach the target apogee without exceeding cost constraints.

**2. Rocket Body:**
   - Materials should offer a balance between weight and structural integrity. Based on previous results, **carbon_fiber** will reduce weight and enhance strength.
   - Wall thickness should support structural forces without excess weight.

**3. Aerodynamics:**
   - **Nose Cone**: An **ogive** shape provides minimized dragâ€”keeping it longer yet lightweight effectively reduces drag.
   - **Fins**: Use **carbon_fiber** for reduced weight and increased strength. Slightly larger span provides needed stability with powerful motors.

**4. Parachute System:**
   - The parachute size needs to be increased enough to ensure safe descent velocity without overly complex design.

**5. Launch Configuration:**
   - Ensures stability with sufficient rail length, while keeping within cost-effective metrics.

### Design Rationale:
- **CesaroniM1670**: Offers needed impulse while being cost-efficient compared to bigger engines like the O3700.
- **Carbon_fiber**: Utilized throughout for its weight-to-strength ratio, optimizing aerodynamic efficiency and remaining structurally sound.
- **Fins and Nose Cone**: Scaled correctly for stability yet mitigate excess drag.
- **Rail Length and Stability**: Adjusted based on motor performance, ensuring a consistent and stable launch.
- **Parachute Configuration**: Guarantees safe descent while maintaining straightforward deployment.

This design aims to achieve a balance between cost efficiency, reaching tested apogee height, and maintaining structural integrity by leveraging aerodynamics and material science.
