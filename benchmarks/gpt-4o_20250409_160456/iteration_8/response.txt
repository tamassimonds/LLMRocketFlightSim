To improve the rocket design while addressing the lessons learned from previous attempts and achieving a closer apogee to the target, we need to balance all elements, including motor selection, body material, aerodynamics, and cost efficiency. Let's break down the strategy:

### Key Improvements:

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - The **CesaroniM1670** showed promise while maintaining reasonable cost and impulse power, but fell short of the target apogee despite being a strong contender when combined with the right design improvements.

2. **Materials:**
   - **Carbon_fiber** was effective in terms of weight and strength. However, a hybrid approach using different materials for the body and aerodynamics might give better results:
     - **Composite** for the rocket body for a lighter structure but retaining durability.
     - **Carbon_fiber** for nose cone and fins where structural rigidity is paramount.

3. **Aerodynamics:**
   - Introduce a refined nose cone and fin design to minimize drag more efficiently.
   - Adjust fin materials for a better balance of weight, drag reduction, and stability.

4. **Parachute Design:**
   - Optimize parachute size ensuring comfortable descent speed without excessive cost.

5. **Launch Configuration:**
   - Increase rail length slightly to capture maximum initial thrust stability.

### Proposed Rocket Configuration:

```python

        "radius": 0.085,  # Adjusted to fit motor, allowing a slight clearance
        "length": 2.0,  # Extended length for improved stability and drag reduction

        "thickness": 0.005,  # Adequate for maintaining structural integrity
    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {
            "kind": "ogive",
            "length": 0.5,  # Longer for improved aerodynamic efficiency
            "material": "carbon_fiber",  # Enhanced strength at lower weight
        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 3,  # Reduced to decrease drag
            "root_chord": 0.22,  # Provides stability necessary for powerful engines

            "thickness": 0.005,
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.25,
            "top_radius": 0.085,
            "bottom_radius": 0.065,  # Differentiated dimensions for design compliance
            "material": "composite",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.34,  # Increased slightly for a controlled descent
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.14,  # Balanced drogue size for initial slowing
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 3.0,  # Increased incrementally for stabilization
        "inclination": 90,  # Vertical launch for maximum thrust utilization
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.15,  # Basic essential systems, keeping minimal weight
        "position": 0.95,  # Adjusted for central balance
    }
}
```

### Rationale for Improved Design:
- This configuration leverages **composite** for a lighter rocket body, maintaining adequate strength.
- **Carbon_fiber** for the nose cone and fins provides strength where structurally essential, accommodating aerodynamic pressure during flight phases.
- Reducing the number of fins decreases drag, while the larger nose cone streamlines airflow over the rocket efficiently.
- A strategic adjustment of parachute size for descent without excessive drag, assisting recovery.
- The slightly extended rail length ensures velocity stability during launch. 

This plan improves upon previous attempts and endeavors to achieve the desired apogee within cost and efficiency constraints. By optimizing the weight and aerodynamic profile, this proposal aims to achieve success in altitude objectives efficiently.
