To improve the rocket design and better achieve the target apogee of 3048 meters, let's analyze the components carefully, focusing on efficient use of materials, better motor selection, cost management, and enhanced aerodynamics. The previous attempts indicate challenges with reaching the target altitude, possibly due to suboptimal motor choice and overall rocket dynamics.

### Revised Design Strategy

**1. Motor Selection:**
   - While the CesaroniO3700 provided more thrust, it significantly increased the cost. Given the constraints in cost and actual performance, we can attempt to use the **CesaroniM1670** again and optimize other factors like drag and weight distribution. This ensures we're not overshooting in weight due to a high-power motor.

**2. Rocket Body:**
   - Optimize for lighter weight while maintaining adequate structural integrity. Slight adjustments in dimensions can lower mass and cost without sacrificing strength.
   - Use **aluminum** instead of fiberglass for the body since it's cheaper and lighter, aiding in increased efficiency.
   - Keep thickness minimal but sufficient for structural needs.

**3. Aerodynamics:**
   - **Nose Cone:** The longer ogive style is good for minimizing drag but doesn't need to be as long as previously proposed.
   - **Fins:** Maintain robustness with a design that helps stabilize without excessive drag. Using **balsa_wood** for fins to further reduce weight and cost can be useful.
  
**4. Parachute System:**
   - Ensure sufficient parachute size to mitigate descent velocity with a focus on cost-effectiveness. Aim to optimize Cd and dimensions.

**5. Launch Configuration:**
   - Maintain the rail length to enable sufficient velocity upon leaving the rail, but do not overextend beyond necessity to minimize cost and complexity.

### Optimized Configuration Proposal:

    },

            "length": 0.35,  # Enough for drag reduction without excess weight

        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.3,  # Carefully tuned for safe landing
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {

            "cd_s": 0.1,  # Slightly larger for improved initial deceleration
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 2.5,  # Provides sufficient initial velocity stabilization
        "inclination": 90,   # Vertical launch for altitude achievement
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.2,  # Essential systems budget
        "position": 0.8,  # Centrally balanced
    }
}
```

### Rationale:
- The use of a lighter motor allows us to reallocate resources to aerodynamic improvements.
- Aluminum and balsa wood are economical choices for reducing cost while maintaining structurally sound design.
- A slightly reduced payload weight allows focus on performance with safety mechanisms optimized for descent.
- This configuration optimizes both cost and performance in an incremental manner, seeking to balance the apogee target with the constraints provided.

I recommend this design to optimize cost, manage weight, and enhance performance toward the target apogee.
