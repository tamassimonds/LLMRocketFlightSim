To design a rocket that successfully meets the target apogee of 3048 meters while balancing cost efficiency, structural integrity, and aerodynamic performance, we must carefully consider the lessons learned from previous attempts.

### Revised Design Strategy

**1. Motor Selection:**
   - The **CesaroniO3700** was selected in a previous design for its high impulse, yet it pushed costs and complexity. To find a middle ground between power and cost, we need a motor with sufficient performance but less overkill than CesaroniO3700.
   - Let's select **CesaroniK160**, which provides a decent impulse and is less expensive and lighter than options like O3700.

**2. Rocket Body:**
   - The body dimensions should accommodate the selected motor comfortably while ensuring structural integrity.
   - **Composite** is chosen for the body's material due to its lightweight nature and strength. This strikes a balance between cost and performance.
   - The thickness should ensure structural support, especially with the launch and landing stresses.

**3. Aerodynamics:**
   - **Nose Cone**: We'll stick with an **ogive** shape for its aerodynamic efficiency but adjust the length for optimal performance.
   - **Fins**: Opt for a lightweight material such as **balsa_wood** or **ABS_plastic** while ensuring they are substantial enough for stability.

**4. Parachute System:**
   - The main parachute should have adequate surface area to slow descent safely, and the drogue should assist in reducing speed before the main chute deploys.

**5. Launch Configuration:**
   - The launch rail should be sufficient to allow for speed build-up without being over-extended.

### Optimized Configuration Proposal:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "CesaroniK160",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.082,  # Slightly larger than the motor for clearance
        "length": 1.8,  # Length to ensure stability
        "material": "composite",
        "thickness": 0.005,  # Provides adequate structural support
    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {
            "kind": "ogive",
            "length": 0.4,  # Proper length for minimizing drag
            "material": "composite",
        },

            "tip_chord": 0.1,

            "cant_angle": 0, 
            "material": "balsa_wood",
            "thickness": 0.004,
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.25,
            "top_radius": 0.082,
            "bottom_radius": 0.07,  # Different for design validity
            "material": "balsa_wood",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.32,  # Optimized for safe landing
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.14,  # Helps initially slow down prior to main deployment
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 2.8,  # Ensures stable initial flight
        "inclination": 90,   # Vertical launch
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.15,  # Necessary electronics only
        "position": 0.9,  # Centered for stability
    }
}
```

### Rationale:
- **CesaroniK160** provides a balance between adequate thrust for altitude and cost effectiveness.
- The body uses composite for a lightweight build but strong enough to handle launch stresses.
- Aerodynamics: Nose and fins designed for drag reduction and stability.
- The parachute system ensures a safe descent with carefully chosen Cd values.
- This configuration leverages lessons from past attempts to try and reach the target apogee efficiently while maintaining cost, structural, and safety considerations.
