To improve the rocket design and achieve a better score, we need to focus on optimizing each component's cost-effectiveness, aerodynamic efficiency, and structural integrity. Let's go through the design process again, making adjustments based on the feedback received:

### Analysis and Design Adjustments

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - The **AeroTechK700W** motor might be underpowered for reaching 3048 meters, despite its low mass. A more powerful motor may be necessary. 
   - **CesaroniM1670** provides significantly more thrust and has a similar Isp to other strong options. Although heavier, it could help achieve the target apogee better within its impulse capacity. 

2. **Rocket Body:**
   - Increase the radius slightly more to accommodate a larger motor and ensure structural integrity with the increased thrust.
   - Material remains **fiberglass** for cost-effectiveness and balance between weight and strength.
   - Increase the thickness marginally to handle the structural loads from a heavier and more powerful motor.

3. **Aerodynamics:**
   - **Nose Cone:** An **ogive** shape is still optimal for drag reduction but revisit length for improved aerodynamics.
   - Fins should be slightly larger for better stability with increased motor thrust.

4. **Parachute Design:**
   - Increase the drag area of the parachutes slightly for a safer landing and adjust the Cd as needed.

5. **Launch Configuration:**
   - Increase the rail length to ensure the rocket is at sufficient velocity to stabilize once it leaves the guiderail. 
   - Keep the inclination vertical to maximize altitude as wind adjustment will be secondary here.

6. **Payload:**
   - Need to adjust the payload's mass lower to account for higher motor weight if payload is non-essential.

### New Config

```python

    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.08,  # Increased to accommodate a larger motor and stability
        "length": 1.8,   # Longer body for increased stability at higher speeds

        "thickness": 0.006,  # Increased thickness for structural integrity
    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {

            "thickness": 0.007,  # Increased thickness for strength
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.25,
            "top_radius": 0.08,
            "bottom_radius": 0.06,  # Different top and bottom radius for DRC compliance
            "material": "carbon_fiber",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.35,  # Increased to improve landing safety
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.12,  # Slightly larger for initial speed reduction
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 2.0,  # Increased to stabilize at higher speeds
        "inclination": 90,   # Vertical launch
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.2,  # Reduced mass for performance improvement
        "position": 0.9,  # Centralized for balancing the load
    }
}
```

This revised configuration accounts for a more powerful motor, ensuring potential reach to the target altitude. Adjustments in the body, fin size, and thickness provide stability and robustness, while a slight increase in parachute drag area helps ensure a safer landing. Balancing these changes aims to improve the score by enhancing safety, effectiveness, and cost-efficiency.
