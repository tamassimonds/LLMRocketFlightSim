To improve the rocket design and achieve a better score, we need to critically analyze previous attempts and refine the configuration by focusing on achieving the right balance of motor power, material selection, and aerodynamic efficiency. Here’s a detailed breakdown and refined strategy:

### Analysis and Strategic Design Adjustments

**1. Motor Selection:**
   - **Previous Attempts:** The motors used varied widely in impulse and thrust, where the CesaroniM1670 offered moderate performance but didn't quite reach the target apogee.
   - **Refined Choice:** The **AeroTechK700W** motor provides a better balance of thrust and weight, making it a potential candidate if coupled with a lightweight, efficient design. Its decent thrust-to-weight ratio and reasonable cost keep it competitive.

**2. Rocket Body:**
   - **Previous Material Choices:** The use of **carbon_fiber** and **composite** have been emphasized for their lightweight and strong nature.
   - **Optimized Material:** Employ **composite** for the body, as it provides a superior balance between cost and structural strength.
   - **Design Adjustments:** A streamlined design with minimal thickness that maintains structural integrity is crucial.

**3. Aerodynamic Design:**
   - **Nose Cone and Fins:** Past designs showed larger, heavier configurations that were less effective.
   - **Improved Aerodynamics:** Opt for an **ogive** nose cone. Minimize fin size just enough for stability to reduce drag, using **carbon_fiber** for stiffness without adding much weight.
   - **Fin Configuration:** Reduce fin span and number to minimize drag. 

**4. Parachute System:**
   - Ensure the parachute design provides adequate drag for safe descent, avoiding excess complexity and weight.

**5. Launch Configuration:**
   - Proper rail length is critical to ensuring a stable, efficient initial trajectory. Keep it optimized around the midpoint of past successful tests.

### Rationale:
- **Motor Selection:** The AeroTechK700W’s specification better matches the rocket’s optimized lightweight configuration.
- **Aerodynamics and Body:** Using **carbon_fiber** and **composite**, focusing on reducing overall drag through a streamlined design with effective materials.
- **Parachute System:** Balanced between safety and cost efficiency, ensuring landing without major structural changes.
- The configuration aims to improve the apogee approach while curbing cost and maximizing aerodynamic efficiency.

This proposal considers an improved distribution of strength, cost, thrust, and drag reduction, designed for greater alignment with the target apogee and improved score.
