### Analysis of Previous Attempts:
1. **Best Performing Design (Attempt 7)**:
   - **Score**: 85.56 (highest achieved)
   - **Apogee**: 2836.94m (6.92% undershoot)
   - **Cost**: $699.66 (excellent)
   - **Key Features**: Pro75M1670 motor, von Karman nose, 3 carbon fiber fins

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The Pro75M1670 motor is the best balance of cost and performance but still slightly underpowered.
   - Aerodynamic optimizations (nose cone, fins) helped but couldn't fully compensate.
   - Need to **minimize drag further** while maintaining stability in 5 m/s wind.

### Optimized Design Strategy:
1. **Motor Selection**:
   - Keep **Pro75M1670** (best cost/impulse ratio for target).
   - Add **0.6kg payload** (slightly more mass helps utilize impulse efficiently).

2. **Aerodynamics**:
   - **Nose Cone**: "lvhaack" (best supersonic performance, better than von Karman in simulations).
   - **Fins**: 3 fins (minimum for stability), reduced size (span = 0.07m), carbon fiber for strength.
   - **Cant Angle**: 0° (no spin-induced drag; stability from fin placement alone).

3. **Materials**:
   - **Body**: Fiberglass (cost-effective, sufficient strength).
   - **Fins**: Carbon fiber (lightweight, rigid).
   - **Nose**: Composite (optimal aerodynamics).

4. **Recovery**:
   - **Main Chute**: Cd_s = 0.5 (safe landing <5 m/s).
   - **Drogue**: Cd_s = 0.15 (minimal drift).

5. **Launch**:
   - **Rail Length**: 1.8m (longer for stability).
   - **Inclination**: 89° (1° into wind to counter 5 m/s drift).
   - **Heading**: 90° (east, into wind).

### Expected Performance:
- **Apogee**: 2950–3100m (within 3% of target).
- **Cost**: ~$750 (under $1000 threshold).
- **Landing**: ~4.8 m/s (safe).
- **Drift**: <250m (wind-compensated launch).
- **Structural**: No failures.

### Key Improvements Over Attempt 7:
1. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Zero cant angle eliminates spin drag.
   - LV-Haack nose cone improves supersonic performance.
   - Smaller fins reduce drag while maintaining stability.

2. **Mass Optimization**:
   - Increased payload (0.6kg) better utilizes motor impulse.

3. **Cost Control**:
   - Fiberglass body and carbon fiber fins balance cost/performance.

This design should maximize the score by:
- Getting closer to the apogee target (reducing error to ~3%).
- Maintaining low cost.
- Ensuring safe landing and minimal drift.
