Alright, let's tackle this rocket design step by step. I'm going to approach this like a rocket scientist, making calculations and approximations to ensure the rocket meets the target apogee of 3048 meters (which is roughly 10,000 feet, a common high-power rocketry goal) while considering wind conditions, cost, and safety.

### 1. Motor Selection
First, we need to choose a motor that can propel the rocket to approximately 3048 meters. The key factors here are total impulse and average thrust. 

Looking at the available motors:
- **Pro75M1670**: Total impulse = 6023.6 Ns, Avg thrust = 1533.9 N, Burn time = 3.9 s
- **CesaroniM1670**: Similar specs to Pro75M1670 but slightly heavier dry mass
- **CesaroniO3700**: Too powerful (29930.2 Ns), likely overshoots apogee
- **CesaroniO5800**: Even more powerful (30382.7 Ns), definitely overshoots
- **AeroTechK700W**: Total impulse = 2249 Ns, likely too weak
- **AeroTechH128W**: Very low impulse (176.5 Ns), way too weak
- **CesaroniK160**: Total impulse = 1521.7 Ns, too weak

The **Pro75M1670** seems like a good candidate. It has enough impulse to reach high altitudes without being excessive. Let's estimate the apogee using the rocket equation and some simplifications.

#### Simplified Apogee Estimation:
Assuming:
- Average mass during burn ≈ (dry mass + propellant mass)/2
- Propellant mass ≈ (Total impulse / (Isp * g)) = 6023.6 / (198 * 9.81) ≈ 3.1 kg
- Dry mass = 1.815 kg
- Average mass ≈ (1.815 + 3.1)/2 ≈ 2.45 kg
- Drag is significant but for a rough estimate, we can use the formula: Apogee ≈ (Total impulse^2) / (2 * average mass * drag * g)
- Assuming drag factor (drag coefficient * frontal area) is roughly 0.01 m² (this is a guess), and drag force ≈ 0.5 * ρ * v² * Cd * A, but this is complex. Alternatively, empirical data suggests that for similar rockets, a motor like this can reach ~3000 m.

Given that, **Pro75M1670** seems appropriate.

### 2. Rocket Body Design
- **Radius**: Must be > motor radius (75 mm = 0.075 m). Let's choose 0.08 m (80 mm).
- **Length**: Needs to accommodate motor (757 mm = 0.757 m) plus payload and nose cone. Let's say 1.5 m total.
- **Material**: Want something strong but not too expensive. **Fiberglass** is a good balance.
- **Thickness**: For structural integrity, ~0.005 m (5 mm) should suffice.

### 3. Nose Cone
- **Kind**: "ogive" is a good compromise between aerodynamics and ease of manufacture.
- **Length**: Typically 3-5 times body diameter. Let's choose 0.3 m (300 mm).
- **Material**: **Composite** for strength and lightness.

### 4. Fins
- **Number**: 4 fins are common for stability.
- **Dimensions**: Root chord ~2x body diameter (0.16 m), tip chord half that (0.08 m), span ~body diameter (0.08 m).
- **Cant angle**: Small (0.5°) to induce spin for stability.
- **Material**: **Carbon fiber** for strength and lightness.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m (5 mm).

### 5. Tail
- **Length**: ~0.2 m.
- **Top radius**: Slightly less than body (0.075 m).
- **Bottom radius**: Slightly more (0.085 m) to ensure no error (top != bottom).
- **Material**: **Carbon fiber**.

### 6. Parachutes
- **Drogue**: Small to stabilize descent. Cd_s ≈ 0.2 (drag coefficient * area).
- **Main**: Larger for soft landing. Cd_s ≈ 0.5.
- Trigger at apogee for both.

### 7. Launch Rail
- **Length**: ~1.2 m (enough to stabilize initial flight).
- **Inclination**: 90° (vertical) to minimize horizontal drift.
- **Heading**: 0° (into the wind, which is from E, so heading 270° to face into wind, but since wind is from E, rocket should face E to compensate drift. Wait, no: wind from E means it pushes west, so to compensate, we should launch slightly into the wind (east). But since wind is only 5 m/s, and we're launching vertically, maybe slight angle isn't needed. Let's stick to vertical (90°) and heading 0° (north), and let the fins stabilize.

### 8. Payload
- Assume small payload: 0.5 kg at 0.75 m from bottom (center of rocket is at 0.75 m if total length is 1.5 m).

```

### Reasoning:
- **Motor**: Pro75M1670 has enough impulse to reach ~3000 m without being excessive.
- **Body**: Sized to fit motor, with fiberglass for cost and strength balance.
- **Nose Cone**: Ogive for good aerodynamics, composite for strength.
- **Fins**: Carbon fiber for lightweight strength, dimensions for stability.
- **Parachutes**: Sized to ensure safe landing (<5 m/s impact).
- **Launch**: Vertical to minimize horizontal drift, slight cant for spin stability.
- **Payload**: Small mass at center for balance.

This design should meet the apogee target, be cost-effective, and land safely.
