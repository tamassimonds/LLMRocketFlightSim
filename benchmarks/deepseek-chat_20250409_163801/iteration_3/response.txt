### Analysis of Previous Attempts:
1. **Attempt 1 (Pro75M1670)**:
   - Undershot apogee by 10% (2741m vs 3048m)
   - Cost: $738 (reasonable)
   - Structural integrity passed

2. **Attempt 2 (CesaroniM1670)**:
   - Performed worse (2628m, 13.75% undershoot)
   - Higher cost ($896) due to carbon fiber
   - Key issue: Heavier motor (3.1kg vs 1.8kg) hurt performance

### Key Insights:
- The Pro75 motor family is better suited for this apogee
- Need more impulse without excessive weight
- Must balance drag reduction and stability
- Cost optimization needed (carbon fiber too expensive)

### Improved Design Strategy:
1. **Motor Selection**:
   - Stick with **Pro75M1670** (better mass/impulse ratio)
   - Add slight payload increase (0.6kg) for better mass distribution

2. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Use **elliptical nose cone** (lower drag than ogive)
   - Increase fin span slightly (0.09m) for stability in 5m/s wind
   - Reduce cant angle to 0.3째 (less drag from spin)

3. **Materials**:
   - Body: **Fiberglass** (best cost/performance)
   - Fins: **Plywood** (cheaper than carbon fiber, sufficient strength)
   - Nose: **Composite** (optimal for aerodynamics)

4. **Parachutes**:
   - Larger drogue (Cd_s=0.25) for better descent control
   - Slightly smaller main (Cd_s=0.45) to reduce drift

5. **Launch Parameters**:
   - 1째 inclination into wind (heading 90째 east) to counter 5m/s wind
   - Longer rail (1.5m) for better initial stability

### Performance Calculations:
- Estimated total mass: ~5kg (motor + structure + payload)
- Drag reduction from elliptical nose: ~5% altitude gain
- Wind compensation: <200m horizontal drift
- Cost estimate: ~$700 (better than Attempt 2)

### Expected Performance:
- **Apogee**: 2980-3100m (within 2% of target)
- **Cost**: ~$710 (better than Attempt 2)
- **Landing**: <5m/s impact velocity
- **Drift**: <400m horizontal
- **Structural**: No failures

This design optimizes all scoring parameters by:
1. Better matching apogee target
2. Reducing cost through material choices
3. Ensuring safe landing
4. Minimizing drift with wind compensation
5. Maintaining structural integrity
