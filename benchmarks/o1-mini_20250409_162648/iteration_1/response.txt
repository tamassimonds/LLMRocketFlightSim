To design a rocket that meets the specified requirements, we need to carefully select components and optimize the design for performance, cost, and safety. Below is a detailed reasoning behind each design choice, followed by the final configuration in the required Python dictionary format.

## Design Reasoning

### 1. **Motor Selection**

**Available Motors:**
- **AeroTechK700W**
  - *Total Impulse*: 2249 Ns
  - *Avg Thrust*: 658.7 N
  - *Burn Time*: 3.5 s
  - *Isp*: 177.5 s
- **CesaroniK160**
  - *Total Impulse*: 1521.7 Ns
  - *Avg Thrust*: 190.2 N
  - *Burn Time*: 9.7 s
  - *Isp*: 182.9 s
- **Pro75M1670**
  - *Total Impulse*: 6023.6 Ns
  - *Avg Thrust*: 1533.9 N
  - *Burn Time*: 3.9 s
  - *Isp*: 198 s

**Choice:** **AeroTechK700W**

**Reasoning:**
- **Total Impulse**: With an impulse of 2249 Ns, it provides sufficient thrust to achieve the target apogee of 3048 meters.
- **Weight Efficiency**: Lower dry mass compared to high-impulse motors like Pro75M1670, reducing overall rocket mass and improving efficiency.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Balances performance with cost, avoiding the higher prices associated with more powerful motors.
- **Isp**: High specific impulse ensures efficient fuel usage.

### 2. **Rocket Body Design**

- **Radius**: **0.08 meters**
  - *Justification*: Must exceed the motor radius of 0.054 meters, providing structural integrity and space for payload.
- **Length**: **1.0 meter**
  - *Justification*: Adequate length to house the motor, payload, and recovery system.
- **Material**: **Composite**
  - *Justification*: Offers a good balance between strength, weight, and cost.

### 3. **Nose Cone Design**

- **Kind**: **Ogive**
  - *Justification*: Provides smooth aerodynamics, reducing drag and improving stability.

- **Tip Chord**: **0.075 meters**
- **Span**: **0.3 meters**
- **Cant Angle**: **0 degrees**
  - *Justification*: Simplifies construction and maintains straight airflow.
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**
  - *Justification*: High strength-to-weight ratio ensures fins maintain shape under aerodynamic forces.
- **Thickness**: **0.005 meters**
  - *Justification*: Ensures durability while minimizing weight.

### 5. **Tail Design**

- **Length**: **0.2 meters**
- **Top Radius**: **0.04 meters**
- **Bottom Radius**: **0.05 meters**
  - *Justification*: Differing radii avoid structural errors and ensure proper airflow separation.
- **Material**: **Composite**
  - *Justification*: Consistent with rocket body for uniform strength and weight distribution.

### 6. **Parachute Specifications**

- **Main Parachute:**
  - *cd_s*: **0.25**
  - *Trigger*: **apogee**
  - *Sampling Rate*: **105**
  - *Lag*: **1.5 seconds**
  - *Noise*: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**
- **Drogue Parachute:**
  - *cd_s*: **0.2**
  - *Trigger*: **apogee**
  - *Sampling Rate*: **105**
  - *Lag*: **1.5 seconds**
  - *Noise*: **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**Reasoning:**
- Proper sizing of parachutes ensures a safe landing with impact velocity below 5 m/s.
- Redundant parachutes (main and drogue) enhance reliability.

### 7. **Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length**: **1.0 meter**
  - *Justification*: Provides stability during initial launch phase.
- **Inclination**: **90 degrees**
  - *Justification*: Vertical launch ensures maximum altitude gain.
- **Heading**: **0 degrees**
  - *Justification*: Aligns with the vertical axis, minimizing horizontal drift.

### 8. **Payload Specifications**

- **Mass**: **0.5 kg**
  - *Justification*: Lightweight payload ensures the motor's thrust is sufficient to achieve the target apogee.
- **Position**: **0.5 meters**
  - *Justification*: Balances the rocket's center of mass for stability.

### 9. **Cost and Structural Integrity Considerations**

- **Material Selection**: Composite and carbon fiber are chosen for their strength-to-weight ratios, ensuring structural integrity without excessive cost.
- **Design Efficiency**: Optimizing dimensions and component choices to minimize material usage and cost while maintaining performance.
