## **Design Reasoning**

### **1. Motor Selection**

**Chosen Motor:** **CesaroniO5800**

**Specifications:**
- **Total Impulse:** 30382.7 Ns
- **Dry Mass:** 12.418 kg
- **Avg Thrust:** 5040.2 N
- **Isp:** 222 s

**Reasoning:**
- **High Total Impulse:** The **CesaroniO5800** provides the highest total impulse among the available motors, which is crucial for achieving the desired apogee of **3048 meters**.
- **Efficiency:** With a specific impulse (**Isp**) of **222 seconds**, this motor ensures efficient fuel utilization, translating to better performance.
- **Thrust Profile:** The substantial average thrust guarantees a robust ascent capable of overcoming gravitational forces and atmospheric drag.
  
**Consideration:**
- **Dry Mass:** The motor's dry mass is significant (**12.418 kg**). To balance this, strategic mass optimizations in other components and the introduction of ballast mass are necessary to maintain an optimal thrust-to-weight ratio.

### **2. Mass Optimization and Apogee Estimation**

**Objective:** Align the rocket's total mass to achieve an apogee as close as possible to **3048 meters**.

**Current Scenario:**
- **Achieved Apogee:** 3233.39 meters
- **Total Mass:** ~17.365 kg
- **Error:** +6.08%

**Target Apogee:** 3048.0 meters

**Calculation:**
Assuming a simplified proportional relationship:
\[
\frac{\text{Apogee}_{\text{target}}}{\text{Apogee}_{\text{current}}} = \frac{\text{Mass}_{\text{current}}}{\text{Mass}_{\text{target}}}
\]
\[
\frac{3048}{3233.39} \approx \frac{17.365}{\text{Mass}_{\text{target}}}
\]
\[
\text{Mass}_{\text{target}} \approx \frac{17.365 \times 3233.39}{3048} \approx 18.43 \, \text{kg}
\]

**Action:**
Introduce a **ballast mass** of approximately **1.07 kg** to increase the total mass from **17.365 kg** to **18.43 kg**. This adjustment is expected to reduce the achieved apogee from **3233.39 meters** to **3048 meters**, thereby minimizing the error margin.
