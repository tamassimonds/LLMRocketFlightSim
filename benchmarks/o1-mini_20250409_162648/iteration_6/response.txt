### 10. **Mass and Apogee Calculations**

**Estimated Total Mass:**

| Component           | Mass (kg) |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Motor (CesaroniO5800)| 12.418    |
| Payload             | 0.5       |
| Rocket Body         | 3.217     |
| Nose Cone           | 0.15      |
| Fins                | 0.48      |
| Tail                | 0.3       |
| Parachutes          | 0.3       |
| **Total**           | **17.365** |

**Apogee Estimation:**

Using the proportional relationship based on previously achieved apogees:

\[
\text{Apogee} \propto \frac{\text{Total Impulse}}{\text{Total Mass}}
\]

In **Attempt 2**, using **CesaroniO5800** (30382.7 Ns) achieved an apogee of ~3325m with a mass significantly higher. In our optimized design, we've reduced the mass to **17.365 kg** from previous higher masses.

Assuming the simulation accounts for aerodynamic efficiency improvements, we can anticipate an apogee closer to the target.

**Predicted Apogee:**

Given the high total impulse and reduced mass, it's reasonable to estimate the apogee to be within **2800 to 3200 meters**, positioning us close to the target with a minimal margin of error.

### 11. **Cost Considerations**

**Assumptions:**
- **Composite Materials:** Moderate cost.
- **Fiberglass Fins:** Cost-effective due to material and simpler construction.
- **Balsa Wood Nose Cone:** Low cost.
- **CesaroniO5800 Motor:** High cost but essential for achieving target apogee.

**Estimated Cost Breakdown:**

| Component           | Cost ($)  |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Motor (CesaroniO5800)| 500       |
| Payload             | 50        |
| Rocket Body         | 200       |
| Nose Cone           | 20        |
| Fins                | 100       |
| Tail                | 150       |
| Parachutes          | 60        |
| Launch Rail         | 50        |
