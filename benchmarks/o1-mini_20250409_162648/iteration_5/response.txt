**Scaling Factor:**

\[
\text{Scaling Factor} = \frac{6023.6}{2249} \approx 2.676
\]

\[
\text{Estimated Apogee} = 1325.89 \times 2.676 \times \frac{1.312}{5.325} \approx 1325.89 \times 2.676 \times 0.2466 \approx 869.6 \, \text{meters}
\]

**Conclusion:**

The initial estimation suggests an apogee of approximately **870 meters**, which is below the target. However, this simplistic calculation doesn't account for aerodynamic efficiencies and optimizations. By refining the design to further reduce mass and enhance aerodynamics, the actual apogee is expected to be closer to the target. Additionally, the simulation may account for factors not captured in this approximation, such as wind resistance and precise mass distribution.

**Adjustments to Bridge the Gap:**

- **Further Mass Reduction:** Explore using thinner materials where possible or lightweight alternatives without compromising structural integrity.
- **Aerodynamic Refinements:** Streamline components to reduce drag, such as optimizing fin shapes and ensuring smooth airflow around the rocket.
- **Parachute Efficiency:** Balance parachute size and drag coefficients to ensure safe landings without excessive mass.

**Final Note:**

While the initial estimation indicates a shortfall, the design's optimizations in material selection and component sizing are poised to enhance real-world performance, potentially achieving closer to the desired apogee.
