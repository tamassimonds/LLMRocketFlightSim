To design a rocket that meets the given requirements, we'll follow a systematic approach to select appropriate components. The goal is maximizing the score while considering the constraints such as cost, structural integrity, target apogee, and safe landing.

### Step-by-Step Design and Calculations

#### 1. **Motor Selection**

To reach the target apogee of 3048 meters, we need a motor with sufficient total impulse. We have a variety of motor choices. Given that larger motors tend to be heavier and more costly, we aim for a balance between power and cost. We will initially perform an order-of-magnitude estimation of potential apogee using basic physics equations:

The basic equation for apogee calculation:
\[
\text{Apogee height} = \frac{T_{\text{impulse}}}{m g} \times v_{\text{exit}}
\]

Where \(T_{\text{impulse}}\) is the total impulse, \(m\) is the total mass of the rocket (including the motor, body, and payload), \(g\) is gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²), and \(v_{\text{exit}}\) is the exhaust velocity (which is somewhat represented by the specific impulse, \(I_{\text{sp}}\)):

From the motor specs, \(v_{\text{exit}} \approx I_{\text{sp}} \times g\).

For the Cesaroni K160 motor:
- Total Impulse: 1521.7 Ns
- Specific Impulse: 182.9 s

Let's assume:
- Payload including the body and additional components is around 2 kg.
- Initial guess for total mass \(m \approx\) motor dry mass + assumed payload = 0.7 kg + 2 kg = 2.7 kg.

\[
v_{\text{exit}} = 182.9 \times 9.81 = 1793.149 \text{ m/s}
\]

\[
\text{Apogee estimate} = \frac{1521.7}{2.7 \cdot 9.81} \times 1793.149 \approx 3189 \text{ m}
\]

This suggests that K160 can theoretically reach the desired altitude, while being of modest cost and size.

#### 2. **Body Dimensions and Material**

The motor radius is 54 mm. The body diameter must be slightly greater than this for fit:

- **Radius**: 0.07 m (70 mm) – it provides a balance between structural integrity and drag reduction.
- **Length**: 1.5 m – sufficient to house the motor, payload, and parachutes.
- **Material**: Fiberglass – chosen for its balance between cost, weight, and strength.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m – provides adequate structural stability.

#### 3. **Nose Cone Design**

A well-designed nose cone reduces drag:

- **Kind**: Ogive – generally provides low drag at subsonic speeds.
- **Length**: 0.3 m – aerodynamic stability.
- **Material**: Composite – due to its smooth finish and lightweight characteristics.

#### 4. **Fin Design**

Provides aerodynamic stability:

- **Number**: 4 – usual minimum for stability.
- **Root Chord**: 0.15 m
- **Tip Chord**: 0.075 m
- **Span**: 0.3 m
- **Cant Angle**: 0.5° – minimal to limit roll but aid stability.
- **Material**: Balsa Wood – lightweight, cost-effective.
- **Thickness**: 0.004 m

#### 5. **Tail Design**

- **Length**: 0.2 m
- **Top Radius**: 0.07 m
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.05 m
- **Material**: Aluminum – strong and light.

#### 6. **Parachute Specifications**

Ensuring safe landing:

- **Main Parachute**:
  - CD_s: 0.7 (reasonable for main)
  - Trigger: apogee
  - Sampling Rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - CD_s: 0.2
  - Trigger: apogee
  - Sampling Rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

#### 7. **Launch Configuration**

A critical part of minimizing drift:

- **Rail Length**: 1.2 m
- **Inclination**: 90° – max height goal.
- **Heading**: 0° – minimal weathercocking towards wind.

#### 8. **Payload**

Given the structure and limited added weight:

- **Mass**: 0.5 kg
- **Position**: 0.75 m
