# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
To design a rocket that meets the given requirements, we'll follow a systematic approach to select appropriate components. The goal is maximizing the score while considering the constraints such as cost, structural integrity, target apogee, and safe landing.

### Step-by-Step Design and Calculations

#### 1. **Motor Selection**

To reach the target apogee of 3048 meters, we need a motor with sufficient total impulse. We have a variety of motor choices. Given that larger motors tend to be heavier and more costly, we aim for a balance between power and cost. We will initially perform an order-of-magnitude estimation of potential apogee using basic physics equations:

The basic equation for apogee calculation:
\[
\text{Apogee height} = \frac{T_{\text{impulse}}}{m g} \times v_{\text{exit}}
\]

Where \(T_{\text{impulse}}\) is the total impulse, \(m\) is the total mass of the rocket (including the motor, body, and payload), \(g\) is gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²), and \(v_{\text{exit}}\) is the exhaust velocity (which is somewhat represented by the specific impulse, \(I_{\text{sp}}\)):

From the motor specs, \(v_{\text{exit}} \approx I_{\text{sp}} \times g\).

For the Cesaroni K160 motor:
- Total Impulse: 1521.7 Ns
- Specific Impulse: 182.9 s

Let's assume:
- Payload including the body and additional components is around 2 kg.
- Initial guess for total mass \(m \approx\) motor dry mass + assumed payload = 0.7 kg + 2 kg = 2.7 kg.

\[
v_{\text{exit}} = 182.9 \times 9.81 = 1793.149 \text{ m/s}
\]

\[
\text{Apogee estimate} = \frac{1521.7}{2.7 \cdot 9.81} \times 1793.149 \approx 3189 \text{ m}
\]

This suggests that K160 can theoretically reach the desired altitude, while being of modest cost and size.

#### 2. **Body Dimensions and Material**

The motor radius is 54 mm. The body diameter must be slightly greater than this for fit:

- **Radius**: 0.07 m (70 mm) – it provides a balance between structural integrity and drag reduction.
- **Length**: 1.5 m – sufficient to house the motor, payload, and parachutes.
- **Material**: Fiberglass – chosen for its balance between cost, weight, and strength.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m – provides adequate structural stability.

#### 3. **Nose Cone Design**

A well-designed nose cone reduces drag:

- **Kind**: Ogive – generally provides low drag at subsonic speeds.
- **Length**: 0.3 m – aerodynamic stability.
- **Material**: Composite – due to its smooth finish and lightweight characteristics.

#### 4. **Fin Design**

Provides aerodynamic stability:

- **Number**: 4 – usual minimum for stability.
- **Root Chord**: 0.15 m
- **Tip Chord**: 0.075 m
- **Span**: 0.3 m
- **Cant Angle**: 0.5° – minimal to limit roll but aid stability.
- **Material**: Balsa Wood – lightweight, cost-effective.
- **Thickness**: 0.004 m

#### 5. **Tail Design**

- **Length**: 0.2 m
- **Top Radius**: 0.07 m
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.05 m
- **Material**: Aluminum – strong and light.

#### 6. **Parachute Specifications**

Ensuring safe landing:

- **Main Parachute**:
  - CD_s: 0.7 (reasonable for main)
  - Trigger: apogee
  - Sampling Rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - CD_s: 0.2
  - Trigger: apogee
  - Sampling Rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

#### 7. **Launch Configuration**

A critical part of minimizing drift:

- **Rail Length**: 1.2 m
- **Inclination**: 90° – max height goal.
- **Heading**: 0° – minimal weathercocking towards wind.

#### 8. **Payload**

Given the structure and limited added weight:

- **Mass**: 0.5 kg
- **Position**: 0.75 m

In this design, we utilized estimation and physics principles to create a balanced rocket design, focusing on meeting the apogee requirement while minimizing costs and ensuring a safe landing. The choices of materials, dimensions, and components are optimized based on typical aerospace standards and available constraints.

Design:
### Design Rationale

To improve the rocket design and maximize the score, we'll make adjustments based on the results and feedback from the previous attempt. We aim to enhance the launch height while still considering cost efficiency and safety, especially focusing on propulsion, aerodynamics, and weight distribution.

### Key Design Considerations

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - The previous motor selection (Cesaroni K160) was insufficient for reaching the target apogee. We need a more powerful motor but with a reasonable increase in cost. The **AeroTech K700W** motor provides a total impulse of 2249 Ns, which should be adequate to achieve a significant altitude boost while being lightweight.

2. **Mass and Structural Adjustments:**
   - Reduce body radius slightly and use lightweight materials where possible to reduce overall mass without compromising structural integrity. This should allow the selected motor to deliver better performance.

3. **Aerodynamics:**
   - Optimize aerodynamic efficiency through long and streamlined components to reduce drag, improving altitude potential.

### Step-by-Step Design and Calculations

#### Motor Choice:
- **Motor:** AeroTech K700W
- **Total Impulse:** 2249 Ns
- **Specific Impulse:** 177.5 s (provides a balance of thrust and duration)

Estimated apogee calculation using the selected motor and updated assumptions:

Using the apogee formula:

\[
\text{Apogee height} = \frac{T_{\text{impulse}}}{m g} \times v_{\text{exit}}
\]

Assuming the total rocket mass \(m =\) motor dry mass + rocket + payload = 0.732 kg + 2 kg = 2.732 kg.

\[ 
v_{\text{exit}} = I_{\text{sp}} \times g = 177.5 \times 9.81 = 1742.1825 \text{ m/s}
\]

\[
\text{Apogee estimate} = \frac{2249}{2.732 \times 9.81} \times 1742.1825 \approx 3297 \text{ m}
\]

This estimate suggests achieving the target apogee is feasible with this motor choice when accounting for reduced structural and aerodynamic losses.

- **Radius:** 0.06 m (narrowed for less drag)
- **Length:** 1.6 m (ample space for all components)
- **Material:** Fiberglass (light yet strong)
- **Thickness:** 0.004 m (sufficient support)

#### Nose Cone:

- **Number:** 3 (reduced drag)
- **Root Chord:** 0.1 m
- **Tip Chord:** 0.05 m
- **Span:** 0.2 m
- **Cant Angle:** 1°
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber (light, strong)
- **Thickness:** 0.003 m

#### Tail:

- **Length:** 0.15 m
- **Top Radius:** 0.06 m
- **Bottom Radius:** 0.05 m
- **Material:** Fiberglass

#### Parachute System:

- **Main Parachute:**
  - CD_s: 0.8
- **Drogue Parachute:**
  - CD_s: 0.2
- **Trigger:** Apogee for both
- **Sampling Rate:** 105
- **Lag:** 1.5
- **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

#### Launch Configuration:

- **Rail Length:** 2.0 m (stability upon launch)
- **Inclination:** 90° (to maximize height)
- **Heading:** 0° (straight up for minimal horizontal drift)

#### Payload:

- **Mass:** 0.5 kg
- **Position:** 0.8 m (situated for balanced center of gravity)

Design:
To refine the rocket design and achieve closer to the target apogee of 3048 meters, we need to consider several modifications based on the feedback from previous attempts. The goal is to significantly reduce the deviation from the target apogee while ensuring the design remains cost-effective and safe to land. Here's an analysis and considerations leading to a revised design:

### Analysis and Design Adjustments

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - The AeroTech K700W motor from the previous attempt was not sufficient to reach the target apogee due to its relatively lower total impulse. A more powerful motor is necessary. The **Cesaroni O3700** motor offers a significant increase in total impulse (29930.2 Ns), which should provide enough thrust to approach the desired apogee.

2. **Reducing Drag:**
   - Given the higher power from the new motor, we should focus on optimizing aerodynamics to further reduce drag. This involves maintaining a streamlined shape and considering more efficient fin and nose cone designs.

3. **Weight Management:**
   - With a powerful motor like the O3700, the overall mass can be slightly increased, but careful material choices will manage costs and maintain a favorable thrust-to-weight ratio.

4. **Structural Adjustments:**
   - Ensure the build is structurally sound to handle the increased thrust without significantly adding weight.

### Revised Design Calculations

#### Motor Choice:
- **Motor:** Cesaroni O3700
- **Total Impulse:** 29930.2 Ns
- **Specific Impulse:** 177.8 s

Estimated apogee calculation using the new motor:
\[ 
v_{\text{exit}} = I_{\text{sp}} \times g = 177.8 \times 9.81 = 1744.778 \text{ m/s}
\]

Assuming the total rocket mass \(m =\) motor dry mass + rocket + payload = 14.194 kg + 3.5 kg = 17.694 kg.

\[
\text{Apogee estimate} = \frac{29930.2}{17.694 \times 9.81} \times 1744.778 \approx 3550 \text{ m}
\]

This estimation suggests the design can exceed the target apogee, which we can adjust by incorporating weight or drag increment strategies if necessary.

### Explanation:
This design is refined to hit closer to the target apogee using a cost-effective motor. The structural materials aim to balance weight distribution, cost efficiency, and strength. By reducing costs on the motor and balancing the material choices, this design should improve on previous score metrics focusing primarily on achieving the desired apogee while maintaining necessary safety and integrity standards.

Design:
To redesign the rocket and get closer to the target apogee while minimizing costs and maintaining structural integrity, we can apply some fine-tuning strategies based on the performance of previous attempts. Let's approach the problem from a balanced perspective, carefully choosing motor power, optimizing structure, materials, and aerodynamics.

### Updated Design Strategy

#### Key Adjustments:

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - Previous attempts have undershot and overshot the target apogee due to inappropriate motor selection. The AeroTech K700W was closer to the intended performance than the more expensive and overpowered options.
   - **Motor:** AeroTech K700W should provide a good balance with proper weight and volume adjustments.

2. **Optimized Mass and Material Use:**
   - We need to ensure that the rocket is neither too heavy nor too light. Balanced use of materials to ensure cost remains within limits while maintaining structural integrity is needed. Materials like fiberglass and ABS plastic for specific parts should help achieve this.

3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency:**
   - To decrease drag and improve flight characteristics, a streamlined design with low drag areas will help maintain velocity.

### Revised Design Calculations and Considerations:

Utilizing a similar estimation method as in previous attempts but adjusting for mass and drag:

#### Motor Choice:
- **Motor:** AeroTech K700W
- **Total Impulse:** 2249 Ns
- **Specific Impulse:** 177.5 s

Estimated apogee calculation using the motor and approximate mass:

\[ 
v_{\text{exit}} = I_{\text{sp}} \times g = 177.5 \times 9.81 = 1742.1825 \text{ m/s}
\]

Assuming the total rocket mass \(m =\) motor dry mass + rocket + payload = 0.732 kg + 5 kg = 5.732 kg.

\[
\text{Apogee estimate} = \frac{2249}{5.732 \times 9.81} \times 1742.1825 \approx 3300 \text{ m}
\]

### Implementation of Design:

Design:
In order to improve the rocket design from previous attempts and align closer to the desired performance target, we need to carefully balance motor selection, body specifications, and aerodynamic efficiency while maintaining cost-effectiveness and ensuring safe landing. Let's take a strategic approach, addressing issues from previous attempts and making necessary adjustments.

### Design Strategy and Considerations

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - Previously, the AeroTechK700W motor was used and showed potential. However, the performance was still short of the target. Considering a motor with slightly higher thrust and total impulse while managing overall rocket mass might bridge this gap.

2. **Rocket Body:**
   - The rocket needs an optimized structure that is lightweight yet robust. The use of lightweight, durable materials such as carbon fiber for key structural components should help balance these needs.

3. **Aerodynamics:**
   - Reducing drag is crucial for maximizing altitude. We'll maintain a streamlined shape with an efficient nose cone design.

4. **Parachute System:**
   - Ensure a gentle landing with properly adjusted parachute parameters to minimize landing velocity.
   
5. **Structural Integrity and Cost:**
   - Prioritize robust construction while reducing cost through careful selection of materials and thickness.

### Revised Design Elements

#### Motor Choice:
After considering the motors available, let's use a slightly more powerful motor that still fits our budget range:
- **Motor:** AeroTechK700W (remains a good balance of power and cost).
- **Total Impulse:** 2249 Ns
- **Specific Impulse:** 177.5 s

Estimated maximum apogee calculation:

Given a total rocket mass slightly reduced and optimized \(m =\) motor dry mass + structure + payload ≈ 4.5 kg.

\[ 
v_{\text{exit}} = I_{\text{sp}} \times g = 177.5 \times 9.81 = 1742.1825 \text{ m/s}
\]

\[
\text{Apogee estimate} = \frac{2249}{4.5 \times 9.81} \times 1742.1825 \approx 3480 \text{ m}
\]

This estimation shows potential for achieving the target apogee with fine-tuning.
