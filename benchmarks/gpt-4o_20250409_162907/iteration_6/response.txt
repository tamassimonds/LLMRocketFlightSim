In order to improve the rocket design from previous attempts and align closer to the desired performance target, we need to carefully balance motor selection, body specifications, and aerodynamic efficiency while maintaining cost-effectiveness and ensuring safe landing. Let's take a strategic approach, addressing issues from previous attempts and making necessary adjustments.

### Design Strategy and Considerations

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - Previously, the AeroTechK700W motor was used and showed potential. However, the performance was still short of the target. Considering a motor with slightly higher thrust and total impulse while managing overall rocket mass might bridge this gap.

2. **Rocket Body:**
   - The rocket needs an optimized structure that is lightweight yet robust. The use of lightweight, durable materials such as carbon fiber for key structural components should help balance these needs.

3. **Aerodynamics:**
   - Reducing drag is crucial for maximizing altitude. We'll maintain a streamlined shape with an efficient nose cone design.

4. **Parachute System:**
   - Ensure a gentle landing with properly adjusted parachute parameters to minimize landing velocity.
   
5. **Structural Integrity and Cost:**
   - Prioritize robust construction while reducing cost through careful selection of materials and thickness.

### Revised Design Elements

#### Motor Choice:
After considering the motors available, let's use a slightly more powerful motor that still fits our budget range:
- **Motor:** AeroTechK700W (remains a good balance of power and cost).
- **Total Impulse:** 2249 Ns
- **Specific Impulse:** 177.5 s

Estimated maximum apogee calculation:

Given a total rocket mass slightly reduced and optimized \(m =\) motor dry mass + structure + payload ≈ 4.5 kg.

\[ 
v_{\text{exit}} = I_{\text{sp}} \times g = 177.5 \times 9.81 = 1742.1825 \text{ m/s}
\]

\[
\text{Apogee estimate} = \frac{2249}{4.5 \times 9.81} \times 1742.1825 \approx 3480 \text{ m}
\]

This estimation shows potential for achieving the target apogee with fine-tuning.
