### Design Rationale

To improve the rocket design and maximize the score, we'll make adjustments based on the results and feedback from the previous attempt. We aim to enhance the launch height while still considering cost efficiency and safety, especially focusing on propulsion, aerodynamics, and weight distribution.

### Key Design Considerations

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - The previous motor selection (Cesaroni K160) was insufficient for reaching the target apogee. We need a more powerful motor but with a reasonable increase in cost. The **AeroTech K700W** motor provides a total impulse of 2249 Ns, which should be adequate to achieve a significant altitude boost while being lightweight.

2. **Mass and Structural Adjustments:**
   - Reduce body radius slightly and use lightweight materials where possible to reduce overall mass without compromising structural integrity. This should allow the selected motor to deliver better performance.

3. **Aerodynamics:**
   - Optimize aerodynamic efficiency through long and streamlined components to reduce drag, improving altitude potential.

### Step-by-Step Design and Calculations

#### Motor Choice:
- **Motor:** AeroTech K700W
- **Total Impulse:** 2249 Ns
- **Specific Impulse:** 177.5 s (provides a balance of thrust and duration)

Estimated apogee calculation using the selected motor and updated assumptions:

Using the apogee formula:

\[
\text{Apogee height} = \frac{T_{\text{impulse}}}{m g} \times v_{\text{exit}}
\]

Assuming the total rocket mass \(m =\) motor dry mass + rocket + payload = 0.732 kg + 2 kg = 2.732 kg.

\[ 
v_{\text{exit}} = I_{\text{sp}} \times g = 177.5 \times 9.81 = 1742.1825 \text{ m/s}
\]

\[
\text{Apogee estimate} = \frac{2249}{2.732 \times 9.81} \times 1742.1825 \approx 3297 \text{ m}
\]

This estimate suggests achieving the target apogee is feasible with this motor choice when accounting for reduced structural and aerodynamic losses.

#### Body:

- **Radius:** 0.06 m (narrowed for less drag)
- **Length:** 1.6 m (ample space for all components)
- **Material:** Fiberglass (light yet strong)
- **Thickness:** 0.004 m (sufficient support)

#### Nose Cone:

- **Kind:** Von Karman (minimizes drag across subsonic to transonic speeds)
- **Length:** 0.4 m
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber (lightweight, reduces drag)

#### Fins:

- **Number:** 3 (reduced drag)
- **Root Chord:** 0.1 m
- **Tip Chord:** 0.05 m
- **Span:** 0.2 m
- **Cant Angle:** 1°
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber (light, strong)
- **Thickness:** 0.003 m

#### Tail:

- **Length:** 0.15 m
- **Top Radius:** 0.06 m
- **Bottom Radius:** 0.05 m
- **Material:** Fiberglass

#### Parachute System:

- **Main Parachute:**
  - CD_s: 0.8
- **Drogue Parachute:**
  - CD_s: 0.2
- **Trigger:** Apogee for both
- **Sampling Rate:** 105
- **Lag:** 1.5
- **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

#### Launch Configuration:

- **Rail Length:** 2.0 m (stability upon launch)
- **Inclination:** 90° (to maximize height)
- **Heading:** 0° (straight up for minimal horizontal drift)

#### Payload:

- **Mass:** 0.5 kg
- **Position:** 0.8 m (situated for balanced center of gravity)
