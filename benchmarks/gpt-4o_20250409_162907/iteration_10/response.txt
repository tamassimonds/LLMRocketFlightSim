To further improve the rocket design based on previous attempts, the goal is to reduce the error in reaching the target apogee of 3048 meters while maintaining low cost, ensuring structural integrity, and achieving safe landing conditions. The following adjustments will focus on optimizing mass distribution, aerodynamic properties, and overall design efficiency.

### Design Strategy

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - Stick with the **AeroTech K700W** motor as it provides a good balance between performance and cost and has shown potential in previous designs.

2. **Material Selection:**
   - Continue using lightweight, robust, and cost-effective materials but optimize thickness and dimensions to further reduce weight.

3. **Aerodynamics:**
   - Fine-tune nose cone and fin designs to further reduce drag and improve stability.

4. **Weight Management:**
   - Re-assess and adjust the payload and structural masses to optimize the thrust-to-weight ratio.

5. **Parachute System:**
   - Adjust parachute parameters for optimum descent.
