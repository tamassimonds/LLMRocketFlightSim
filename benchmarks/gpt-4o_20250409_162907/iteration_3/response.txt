To refine the rocket design and achieve closer to the target apogee of 3048 meters, we need to consider several modifications based on the feedback from previous attempts. The goal is to significantly reduce the deviation from the target apogee while ensuring the design remains cost-effective and safe to land. Here's an analysis and considerations leading to a revised design:

### Analysis and Design Adjustments

1. **Motor Selection:**
   - The AeroTech K700W motor from the previous attempt was not sufficient to reach the target apogee due to its relatively lower total impulse. A more powerful motor is necessary. The **Cesaroni O3700** motor offers a significant increase in total impulse (29930.2 Ns), which should provide enough thrust to approach the desired apogee.

2. **Reducing Drag:**
   - Given the higher power from the new motor, we should focus on optimizing aerodynamics to further reduce drag. This involves maintaining a streamlined shape and considering more efficient fin and nose cone designs.

3. **Weight Management:**
   - With a powerful motor like the O3700, the overall mass can be slightly increased, but careful material choices will manage costs and maintain a favorable thrust-to-weight ratio.

4. **Structural Adjustments:**
   - Ensure the build is structurally sound to handle the increased thrust without significantly adding weight.

### Revised Design Calculations

#### Motor Choice:
- **Motor:** Cesaroni O3700
- **Total Impulse:** 29930.2 Ns
- **Specific Impulse:** 177.8 s

Estimated apogee calculation using the new motor:
\[ 
v_{\text{exit}} = I_{\text{sp}} \times g = 177.8 \times 9.81 = 1744.778 \text{ m/s}
\]

Assuming the total rocket mass \(m =\) motor dry mass + rocket + payload = 14.194 kg + 3.5 kg = 17.694 kg.

\[
\text{Apogee estimate} = \frac{29930.2}{17.694 \times 9.81} \times 1744.778 \approx 3550 \text{ m}
\]

This estimation suggests the design can exceed the target apogee, which we can adjust by incorporating weight or drag increment strategies if necessary.

This design uses a powerful motor and thoughtful aerodynamics to potentially meet the target apogee, with structural integrity and safe landing considered through balanced material choices and parachute specifications. Adjustments in the future could include fine-tuning weight distribution or slightly altering components if the estimated apogee is significantly overshot.
