To improve on the previous rocket design and achieve better performance in reaching the target apogee of 3048 meters while considering the constraints and scoring factors, we will reevaluate each component of the rocket by making adjustments based on aerodynamics, materials, and motor selection.

### Step 1: Motor Selection
Based on the previous selection of `Pro75M1670`, I will switch to `CesaroniM1670` for this attempt. While it has a slightly heavier dry mass of 3.101 kg, it has the same thrust capabilities as the `Pro75M1670`, with a higher total impulse (6023.6 Ns), which should help achieve higher altitudes with a more robust performance envelope.

### Step 2: Rocket Body Dimensions and Material
- **Body Radius:** We will maintain the radius at 0.08 meters as it's a stable design.
- **Length:** An increase from 2.0 meters to 2.5 meters to provide more enclosed volume for stability and auxiliary systems. This increase in length will help increase drag and manage stability during ascent.
- **Material:** I will maintain the choice of composite material for a balance of weight and structural integrity.

### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
- **Shape:** The ogive shape remains, as it has proven to be efficient.
- **Length:** Increase the length from 0.5 meters to 0.6 meters for better aerodynamics and stability.
- **Material:** Continue using composite for consistency.

### Step 4: Fin Design and Material
- **Number of Fins:** Finish with 4 fins.
- **Fin Dimensions**: The fin dimensions will be re-evaluated:
  - Root Chord: Increase to 0.15 meters for enhanced stability.
  - Tip Chord: Increase to 0.08 meters.
  - Span: Maintain at 0.4 meters.
  - **Cant Angle:** 7 degrees will be used for improved lateral control.
- **Material:** Stick with carbon fiber, considering its lightweight nature.

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
- **Main Chute Diameter:** We will increase the diameter slightly to 1.7 meters to provide greater drag upon descent, ensuring a lower landing velocity.
- **Drogue Chute Diameter:** Keep at 0.5 meters for controlled descent.
- **Trigger:** Both parachutes will still deploy at apogee.

### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration
- **Rail Length:** Maintain at 2.0 meters.
- **Inclination:** Stick with 90 degrees for a vertical launch.
- **Heading:** Maintain 0 degrees for a straight ascent.

### Payload
- **Mass:** Increase to 1.0 kg to provide extra weight, which can enhance stability and center of gravity management.
- **Position:** Position at 1.0 meter from the center of gravity to ensure balance.
