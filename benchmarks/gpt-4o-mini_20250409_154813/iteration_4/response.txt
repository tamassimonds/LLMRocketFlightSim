To optimize the rocket design to reach the target apogee of 3048 meters while addressing structural integrity, landing speed, cost, and horizontal distance, let's take a systematic approach. I will tweak the motor selection, structural materials, dimensions, and parachute specifications based on insights from the previous attempts. Here's how we'll proceed:

### Analysis and Design Decisions

#### Step 1: Motor Selection
- **Motor:** Given the high thrust and total impulse needs, I'll select **CesaroniM1670**. Although it has a heavier dry mass compared to the Pro75M1670, it delivers substantial thrust and impulse, which can assist in reaching higher altitudes efficiently.

#### Step 2: Rocket Body Dimensions and Material
- **Body Radius:** To ensure stability, I will select a body radius of **0.1 meters**, which is larger than the motor’s radius (0.075 m).
- **Body Length:** A body length of **2.5 meters** allows for sufficient volume for structural integrity and safety systems.
- **Material:** I'll use **fiberglass** for the body as it is strong, lightweight, and has good resistive qualities.

#### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
- **Shape:** An **ogive** shape will be chosen for reduced aerodynamic drag.
- **Length:** A nose cone length of **0.6 meters** will provide good aerodynamic performance.
- **Material:** I'll stick with **fiberglass** to ensure consistency in structural integrity.

#### Step 4: Fin Design and Material
- **Number of Fins:** I will design the rocket with **4 fins** for sufficient stability during flight.
- **Fin Dimensions:** 
  - Root Chord: **0.15 meters**
  - Tip Chord: **0.075 meters**
  - Span: **0.4 meters**
  - Cant Angle: **5 degrees**
- **Material:** **Carbon fiber** will be utilized for the fins due to its light weight and strength.

#### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
- **Main Chute Diameter:** For safer landings, a diameter of **1.8 meters** for the main chute will be used.
- **Drogue Chute Diameter:** The drogue will maintain a diameter of **0.5 meters**.
- **Trigger:** Both parachutes will deploy at apogee for controlled descent efficiency.

#### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration
- **Rail Length:** I will keep the rail length at **2.0 meters** for adequate launch stability.
- **Inclination:** Set at **90 degrees** to allow for a vertical launch.
- **Heading:** Set at **0 degrees** for a straight ascent.

#### Payload Specifications
- **Mass:** I will use a **payload mass of 0.5 kg** to maintain balance without significantly affecting ascent.
- **Position:** The payload will be positioned at **1.0 meter** from the rocket's center.

### Final Design in Python Dictionary

Based on the above analyses, the final specification for the rocket is as follows:

### Design Summary
1. **Motor:** Selected the **CesaroniM1670** for a favorable balance of thrust and mass.
2. **Body and Nose Cone:** A larger radius and length with a reliable fiberglass construction for stability and strength.
3. **Fins:** Maintained a balanced and tested fin configuration to assure a stable ascent.
4. **Enhanced Parachute Design:** Larger main parachute for safer descent strategies.
