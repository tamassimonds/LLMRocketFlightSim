To design a rocket that meets the target apogee of 3048 meters while ensuring safety and cost-efficiency, we need to carefully select the components and dimensions while optimizing the overall structure for performance. Here’s a systematic approach to create an improved design based on the insights gathered from previous attempts:

### Design Decisions

#### Step 1: Motor Selection
- **Motor:** I will opt for the **CesaroniM1670** motor. Although it has a higher dry mass (3.101 kg), its thrust (2200 N) and total impulse (6023.6 Ns) make it favorable for achieving the target altitude while balancing safety and structural integrity.

#### Step 2: Rocket Body Dimensions and Material
- **Body Radius:** To ensure stability during flight, I will select a radius of **0.085 meters**, which is greater than the motor radius (0.075 meters) but smaller than options that would add unnecessary weight.
- **Body Length:** A longer body aids in structural integrity without excessively increasing weight. I will use a length of **2.2 meters**.
- **Material:** Using **fiberglass** provides a good balance between weight and structural strength.

#### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
- **Shape:** I will continue with the **ogive shape** for aerodynamic efficiency.
- **Length:** A nose cone length of **0.5 meters** strikes a good balance between drag reduction and structural stability.
- **Material:** Matching the body, **fiberglass** will be used for the nose cone.

#### Step 4: Fin Design and Material
- **Number of Fins:** I will keep the configuration of **4 fins** for better stability.
- **Fin Dimensions:** 
  - Root Chord: **0.12 meters**
  - Tip Chord: **0.06 meters**
  - Span: **0.4 meters**
  - Cant Angle: **5 degrees** for optimal stability.
- **Material:** **Carbon fiber** will be used as it is lightweight and durable.

#### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
- **Main Chute Diameter:** The main parachute will have a diameter of **1.6 meters**, providing good drag to ensure a safe descent.
- **Drogue Chute Diameter:** The drogue will maintain a diameter of **0.5 meters**, ensuring controlled descent before the main chute deploys.
- **Trigger:** Both parachutes will deploy at apogee for improved control.

#### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration
- **Rail Length:** I will set a rail length of **2.0 meters** to provide good stability during launch.
- **Inclination:** Set at **90 degrees** for a vertical launch.
- **Heading:** Also set at **0 degrees** for a straight ascent.

#### Payload Specifications
- **Mass:** A payload mass of **0.5 kg** is appropriate for maintaining balance without adding excessive weight.
- **Position:** The payload will be positioned at **1.0 meter** from the rocket's center to maintain balance and stability.

### Final Design in Python Dictionary
Using the above considerations, here’s the complete design configuration in the required Python dictionary format:
