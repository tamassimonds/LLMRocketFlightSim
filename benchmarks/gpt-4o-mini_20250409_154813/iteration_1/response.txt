To design a rocket that meets the specified requirements, we will follow a systematic approach, considering each component to reach the target apogee of 3048 meters while also ensuring safe and efficient landing restrictions. 

### Step 1: Motor Selection
The first step is to select a motor that can achieve the target apogee. Examining the motors provided, we have:

- Pro75M1670 and CesaroniM1670 both have a maximum thrust of 2200 N and significant total impulse, making them suitable candidates. They will have similar performances since they have the same thrust capabilities and technical specs.

- **Selected Motor:** `Pro75M1670`, as it's the lighter option (1.815 kg compared to CesaroniM1670 at 3.101 kg). This helps lower the overall structural weight and possibly allows for more payload or stability features.

### Step 2: Rocket Body Dimensions and Material
To achieve the target apogee of 3048 meters, we need a rocket that can handle the thrust efficiently and also withstand the forces during launch and flight. 

- **Body Radius:** Must be greater than the motor radius of 0.075 meters. A radius of 0.08 meters is an optimal choice for stability.
- **Length:** Using the common amateur rocket body length, I will use 2 meters which provides sufficient volume for auxiliary systems.
- **Material:** Composite material is lightweight yet durable, ensuring the rocket's structural integrity.

### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
The nose cone is crucial for aerodynamics.

- **Shape:** An ogive shape is chosen for efficiency at high speeds.
- **Length:** 0.5 meters balances aerodynamic efficiency and structural requirements.
- **Material:** Also composite, to match the rocket body and maintain structural integrity.

### Step 4: Fin Design and Material
Fins provide stability during flight.

- **Number of Fins:** 4 fins ensure a stable flight.
- **Fin Dimensions:** 
  - Root Chord: 0.12 meters,
  - Tip Chord: 0.06 meters,
  - Span: 0.4 meters.
  
This configuration provides good stability during ascent and descent.
- **Cant Angle:** A slight cant angle of 5 degrees helps with lateral stability.
- **Material:** Carbon fiber for its durability and light weight.

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
Parachutes are essential for safe landing.

- **Main Chute:** Diameter of 1.5 meters is a good balance for drag.
- **Drogue Chute:** With a diameter of 0.5 meters, helps control descent after apogee.
  
Both parachutes will use a trigger set for apogee deployment to ensure a high altitude safe descent.

### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration
A launch rail is necessary for stability during lift-off.

- **Rail Length:** 2 meters is sufficient for a stable launch.
- **Inclination:** 90 degrees for a vertical launch.
- **Heading:** 0 degrees for straight ascent.

### Payload
We have to include a payload that keeps balance:

- **Mass:** A mass of 0.5 kg is practical for a payload, ensuring it does not add excessive weight during ascent or complicate landing dynamics.
- **Position:** Positioned at 0.8 meters from the rocket center to keep the center of gravity balanced.

### Final Design in Python Dictionary
