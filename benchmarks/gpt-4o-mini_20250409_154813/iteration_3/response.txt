Based on your requirements and the observations from previous attempts, we will optimize various components of the rocket to improve the likelihood of reaching the target apogee of 3048 meters while ensuring safe landing and structural integrity. I will reevaluate the motor selection, rocket body, nose cone, fins, parachutes, and other parameters to find an optimal design combination.

### Analysis and Design Decisions

#### Step 1: Motor Selection
To maximize performance, I will select a motor that provides a high total impulse yet maintains a relatively low dry mass. Given the options, I will choose "CesaroniO5800" due to its high total impulse of 30382.7 Ns and significant thrust (6395.5 N). The heavier dry mass is offset by the higher thrust and capabilities to reach the desired altitude.

#### Step 2: Rocket Body Dimensions and Material
- **Body Radius:** The body radius must be greater than the motor radius (0.15 m). I will choose a radius of 0.1 m for the body, which is stable and manageable.
- **Length:** To provide sufficient volume for auxiliary systems and stability, I will select a rocket length of 2.0 m.
- **Material:** I will use composite material for its balance between weight and strength, providing a durable structure.

#### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
- **Shape:** I'll select an ogive shape for the nose cone, as it is ideal for reducing drag at high speeds.
- **Length:** A nose cone length of 0.5 m should provide a good balance for aerodynamics.
- **Material:** Composite material will be consistent with the rocket body for structural integrity.

#### Step 4: Fin Design and Material
- **Number of Fins:** I will stick with 4 fins to enhance flight stability.
- **Fin Dimensions:** 
  - Root Chord: 0.15 m
  - Tip Chord: 0.075 m
  - Span: 0.4 m
- **Cant Angle:** A cant angle of 5 degrees will aid in lateral stability and control.
- **Material:** Carbon fiber is chosen here for its lightweight properties.

#### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
- **Main Chute Diameter:** I will specify a diameter of 1.8 m for the main chute to ensure a lower landing velocity due to higher drag.
- **Drogue Chute Diameter:** The drogue will maintain a diameter of 0.5 m to adequately control descent before the main chute deploys.
- **Trigger:** Both parachutes will deploy at apogee.

#### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration
- **Rail Length:** I will keep the rail length at 2.0 m for stability.
- **Inclination:** 90 degrees for a vertical launch.
- **Heading:** 0 degrees for straight ascent.

#### Payload Specifications
- **Mass:** I will set the payload mass at 0.6 kg to keep it manageable and contribute to overall stability.
- **Position:** Positioned at 0.8 m from the rocket's center to maintain balance.

With these considerations in mind, here is the final rocket design configuration in the required Python dictionary format:

### Summary of Design Choices
1. **Motor Selection:** Utilized a high total impulse motor (CesaroniO5800) to maximize altitude potential.
2. **Body and Nose Cone Dimensions:** Ensured proper aerodynamics and structural integrity with a composite material.
3. **Fin Design:** Opted for a proven configuration of 4 fins with effective dimensions and cant angles for stability.
4. **Parachute Enhancements:** Expanded main parachute diameter for a safer landing approach.
5. **Balanced Payload:** Chose a manageable payload mass centrally located for optimal stability.

This design aims to balance performance while ensuring safety and minimizing costs. I expect this design to achieve significantly better apogee results while remaining structurally stable and economical.
