# Rocket Design Analysis

I'll design a rocket to reach the target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) while optimizing for the scoring criteria. Let me work through this systematically.

## Initial Considerations

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048 meters
2. **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from East
3. **Scoring Factors**:
   - Accuracy to target apogee
   - Cost (lower is better)
   - Landing velocity (must be < 5 m/s for safety)
   - Structural integrity
   - Horizontal distance from launch site (lower is better)

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I need to select an appropriate motor. Let's analyze the available options:

| Motor | Avg Thrust (N) | Burn Time (s) | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 1533.9 | 3.9 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 658.7 | 3.5 | 2249 | 0.732 | Lower |
| CesaroniM1670 | 1533.9 | 3.6 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechH128W | 141.2 | 1.29 | 176.5 | 0.108 | Lowest |
| CesaroniO3700 | 2836.9 | 8.2 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | High |
| CesaroniO5800 | 5040.2 | 5.2 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniK160 | 190.2 | 9.7 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | Lower |

For a 3048m apogee, we need sufficient impulse but not excessive power. The AeroTechK700W or CesaroniK160 seem promising as they provide moderate impulse without excessive weight or cost.

Let's estimate the required impulse using the rocket equation:

Δv = g * Isp * ln(m₀/m₁)

For a rough estimate, assuming a rocket mass of ~2-3kg and targeting ~200 m/s velocity:
- AeroTechK700W: 2249 Ns with Isp of 177.5s
- CesaroniK160: 1521.7 Ns with Isp of 182.9s

The AeroTechK700W provides more impulse while being relatively lightweight, making it a good candidate.

## Body Design Considerations

For a moderate-sized rocket targeting 3048m:
- Body radius: Should be larger than motor radius (54mm for AeroTechK700W = 0.054m)
- Material: Balsa wood or fiberglass offers good strength-to-weight ratio at reasonable cost
- Length: ~0.8-1.0m for stability and reasonable weight

## Aerodynamics

- **Nose cone**: Ogive shape provides good aerodynamic performance
- **Fins**: 3-4 fins with moderate size for stability
- **Tail**: Slight taper for aerodynamic stability

## Parachute System

For a safe landing (<5 m/s):
- Main parachute CD_s: ~1.0-1.5 m² for a ~2-3kg rocket
- Drogue: Smaller parachute to stabilize descent

## Launch Configuration

- Inclination: Slightly angled (85-88°) away from wind direction to compensate for wind drift
- Heading: 270° (West) to counteract the 5 m/s easterly wind

## Final Design

Based on these calculations, here's my optimized rocket design:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "AeroTechK700W",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.06,  # 60mm body radius (> 54mm motor radius)
        "length": 0.9,   # 90cm body length

        "thickness": 0.003,  # 3mm wall thickness
    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {
            "kind": "ogive",
            "length": 0.25,  # 25cm nose cone
            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 3,
            "root_chord": 0.12,  # 12cm root chord
            "tip_chord": 0.06,   # 6cm tip chord

        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.1,       # 10cm tail length
            "top_radius": 0.058, # Slightly less than body radius
            "bottom_radius": 0.06, # Same as body radius
            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 1.2,  # Sized for <5 m/s landing velocity
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.3,  # Small drogue for stability
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.0,  # 1m launch rail
        "inclination": 87,   # Slight angle to compensate for wind
        "heading": 270,      # Launch toward west to counter east wind
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # 300g payload
        "position": 0.3  # Positioned toward the nose
    }
}
```

This design balances:
1. Sufficient impulse to reach target apogee
2. Moderate cost through material selection
3. Safe landing velocity with appropriately sized parachute
4. Structural integrity with appropriate materials
5. Wind compensation through launch angle and heading

The moderate-sized rocket with the AeroTechK700W motor should provide enough impulse to reach the target apogee without excessive cost, while the parachute system ensures a safe landing.
