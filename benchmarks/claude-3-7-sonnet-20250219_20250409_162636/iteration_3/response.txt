# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

I'll approach this design systematically, learning from the previous attempts. The first attempt with AeroTechK700W reached only 2221.74m (27.11% short), while the second attempt with Pro75M1670 reached 2512.16m (17.58% short) but had structural failure issues due to the balsa wood construction.

## Motor Selection Analysis

Looking at the previous attempts and available motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Radius (mm) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 75 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 54 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 75 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 161 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 150 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 54 |

The Pro75M1670 got us closer but still fell short. We need more impulse, but the larger motors (O-class) would likely overshoot our target significantly. The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse as Pro75M1670 but is heavier, which would reduce our apogee. Let's try using the Pro75M1670 again but with a more optimized design.

## Structural Considerations

The second attempt failed structurally with balsa wood. We need stronger materials while keeping weight reasonable:
- Fiberglass offers good strength-to-weight ratio at moderate cost
- Carbon fiber is strongest but most expensive
- Plywood is stronger than balsa but still relatively lightweight

## Body Design Optimization

- Body radius: 0.08m (slightly larger than the 75mm motor)
- Material: Fiberglass for structural integrity
- Length: Optimized to balance stability and weight

## Aerodynamics

- Nose cone: Ogive shape for good aerodynamic performance
- Fins: 4 fins for better stability with fiberglass construction
- Reduced fin size to minimize drag while maintaining stability

## Parachute System

For a safe landing (<5 m/s):
- For a ~3kg rocket: v = sqrt(2mg/ρACd)
- Need cd_s ≈ 1.5-2.0 m²

## Launch Configuration

- Inclination: 89° (nearly vertical for maximum altitude)
- Heading: 270° (West) to counteract the 5 m/s easterly wind

## Weight Reduction Strategy

To reach our target altitude with the Pro75M1670 motor:
1. Use thinner walls where possible
2. Optimize component dimensions
3. Reduce payload mass slightly

This design addresses the issues from previous attempts:

1. **Structural Integrity**: Using fiberglass instead of balsa wood for all components ensures the rocket won't fail structurally during flight.

2. **Weight Optimization**: Reduced wall thickness, component dimensions, and payload mass to improve altitude performance with the Pro75M1670 motor.

3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Streamlined design with optimized fin configuration for stability with minimal drag.

4. **Launch Configuration**: Nearly vertical launch (89°) to maximize altitude potential while still accounting for wind.

5. **Cost Consideration**: Fiberglass offers a good balance between strength and cost compared to carbon fiber.

6. **Safe Landing**: Parachute sized appropriately for a safe landing velocity under 5 m/s.

The Pro75M1670 motor with this optimized, lightweight fiberglass construction should provide sufficient impulse to reach our target altitude of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity throughout the flight.
