# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

Looking at the previous attempts, I can see a clear progression in performance:
- Attempt 1 (AeroTechK700W): 2221.74m (27.11% short), passed structural tests, low cost ($236.79)
- Attempt 2 (Pro75M1670 with balsa): 2512.16m (17.58% short), failed structural tests, moderate cost ($521.35)
- Attempt 3 (Pro75M1670 with fiberglass): 2809.61m (7.82% short), passed structural tests, higher cost ($594.10)

The trend shows we're getting closer to our target apogee, but still falling short. Let's optimize further to reach exactly 3048m.

## Motor Selection Refinement

The Pro75M1670 motor has gotten us closest to our target. We need approximately 8% more altitude, which we can achieve through further design optimization rather than switching to a much more powerful motor.

## Weight and Drag Optimization

To increase our apogee with the same motor:
1. Further reduce weight where possible
2. Minimize drag through aerodynamic refinements
3. Optimize the center of gravity and center of pressure relationship

## Material Selection

Fiberglass provided sufficient structural integrity in attempt 3. For critical components, we'll keep fiberglass, but we can use lighter materials like ABS plastic for non-critical components to reduce weight.

## Detailed Calculations

For a rocket to reach 3048m with the Pro75M1670 motor:
- Total impulse available: 6023.6 Ns
- Estimated rocket mass (without motor): ~1.5kg
- Total mass with motor: ~3.3kg
- Drag coefficient target: minimize to CD < 0.5

To increase our altitude by ~8%, we need to:
- Reduce overall mass by ~5-10%
- Reduce drag by optimizing fin design and nose cone
- Adjust launch angle slightly to account for wind

## Design Rationale

1. **Motor**: Kept the Pro75M1670 as it's gotten us closest to our target altitude.

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Reduced body length from 0.8m to 0.75m
   - Decreased wall thickness from 2.5mm to 2.2mm
   - Reduced fin count from 4 to 3
   - Decreased tail length from 10cm to 8cm
   - Reduced payload mass from 200g to 150g
   - Used lighter ABS plastic for the tail section

3. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Changed nose cone from ogive to von Karman shape for better supersonic performance
   - Optimized fin dimensions (smaller area)
   - Reduced body radius slightly from 80mm to 78mm

4. **Structural Integrity**:
   - Maintained fiberglass for critical components (body, nose cone, fins)
   - Kept sufficient thickness to prevent structural failure

5. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Increased rail length from 1.2m to 1.3m for better initial stability
   - Maintained 88Â° inclination to account for wind drift

6. **Parachute System**:
   - Slightly reduced parachute sizes while ensuring safe landing velocity

These optimizations should provide the additional 8% altitude needed to reach our target of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity, minimizing cost, and ensuring a safe landing.
