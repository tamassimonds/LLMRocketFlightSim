# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

# Rocket Design Analysis

I'll design a rocket to reach the target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) while optimizing for the scoring criteria. Let me work through this systematically.

## Initial Considerations

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048 meters
2. **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from East
3. **Scoring Factors**:
   - Accuracy to target apogee
   - Cost (lower is better)
   - Landing velocity (must be < 5 m/s for safety)
   - Structural integrity
   - Horizontal distance from launch site (lower is better)

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I need to select an appropriate motor. Let's analyze the available options:

| Motor | Avg Thrust (N) | Burn Time (s) | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 1533.9 | 3.9 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 658.7 | 3.5 | 2249 | 0.732 | Lower |
| CesaroniM1670 | 1533.9 | 3.6 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechH128W | 141.2 | 1.29 | 176.5 | 0.108 | Lowest |
| CesaroniO3700 | 2836.9 | 8.2 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | High |
| CesaroniO5800 | 5040.2 | 5.2 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniK160 | 190.2 | 9.7 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | Lower |

For a 3048m apogee, we need sufficient impulse but not excessive power. The AeroTechK700W or CesaroniK160 seem promising as they provide moderate impulse without excessive weight or cost.

Let's estimate the required impulse using the rocket equation:

Δv = g * Isp * ln(m₀/m₁)

For a rough estimate, assuming a rocket mass of ~2-3kg and targeting ~200 m/s velocity:
- AeroTechK700W: 2249 Ns with Isp of 177.5s
- CesaroniK160: 1521.7 Ns with Isp of 182.9s

The AeroTechK700W provides more impulse while being relatively lightweight, making it a good candidate.

## Body Design Considerations

For a moderate-sized rocket targeting 3048m:
- Body radius: Should be larger than motor radius (54mm for AeroTechK700W = 0.054m)
- Material: Balsa wood or fiberglass offers good strength-to-weight ratio at reasonable cost
- Length: ~0.8-1.0m for stability and reasonable weight

## Aerodynamics

- **Nose cone**: Ogive shape provides good aerodynamic performance
- **Fins**: 3-4 fins with moderate size for stability
- **Tail**: Slight taper for aerodynamic stability

## Parachute System

For a safe landing (<5 m/s):
- Main parachute CD_s: ~1.0-1.5 m² for a ~2-3kg rocket
- Drogue: Smaller parachute to stabilize descent

## Launch Configuration

- Inclination: Slightly angled (85-88°) away from wind direction to compensate for wind drift
- Heading: 270° (West) to counteract the 5 m/s easterly wind

## Final Design

Based on these calculations, here's my optimized rocket design:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "AeroTechK700W",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.06,  # 60mm body radius (> 54mm motor radius)
        "length": 0.9,   # 90cm body length

        "thickness": 0.003,  # 3mm wall thickness

            "kind": "ogive",
            "length": 0.25,  # 25cm nose cone
            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 3,
            "root_chord": 0.12,  # 12cm root chord

            "span": 0.08,        # 8cm span
            "cant_angle": 0,     # No cant angle
            "material": "plywood",
            "thickness": 0.004   # 4mm thickness
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.1,       # 10cm tail length
            "top_radius": 0.058, # Slightly less than body radius
            "bottom_radius": 0.06, # Same as body radius
            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 1.2,  # Sized for <5 m/s landing velocity
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.3,  # Small drogue for stability
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.0,  # 1m launch rail
        "inclination": 87,   # Slight angle to compensate for wind
        "heading": 270,      # Launch toward west to counter east wind
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # 300g payload
        "position": 0.3  # Positioned toward the nose
    }
}
```

This design balances:
1. Sufficient impulse to reach target apogee
2. Moderate cost through material selection
3. Safe landing velocity with appropriately sized parachute
4. Structural integrity with appropriate materials
5. Wind compensation through launch angle and heading

The moderate-sized rocket with the AeroTechK700W motor should provide enough impulse to reach the target apogee without excessive cost, while the parachute system ensures a safe landing.

Design:
# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

I'll approach this rocket design systematically, focusing on optimizing for all scoring criteria while ensuring we hit our target apogee of 3048m.

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I need to select an appropriate motor based on the total impulse needed to reach our target altitude. Let's analyze the available motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Radius (mm) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 75 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 54 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 75 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 161 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 150 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 54 |

The previous attempt used AeroTechK700W but fell short of the target apogee by about 27%. This suggests we need more impulse. The Pro75M1670 offers significantly more impulse (6023.6 Ns vs 2249 Ns) with a reasonable mass increase, making it a better candidate for our target altitude.

## Rocket Mass and Impulse Calculation

For a rough estimate of required impulse:
- Target altitude: 3048m
- Gravitational potential energy: m × g × h
- Assuming total rocket mass ~3-4kg (including motor)
- Energy needed: 4kg × 9.81m/s² × 3048m ≈ 120,000 J
- With efficiency losses and drag, we need approximately 5000-6000 Ns of impulse

This confirms Pro75M1670 (6023.6 Ns) should be appropriate for our target.

## Body Design Optimization

- Body radius: Must exceed motor radius (75mm = 0.075m for Pro75M1670)
- Material: Balsa wood offers excellent strength-to-weight ratio at low cost
- Length: Optimized for stability while minimizing weight and drag

## Aerodynamics

- Nose cone: Ogive shape for good aerodynamic performance
- Fins: 3 fins for stability with minimal drag
- Center of pressure must be behind center of gravity for stability

## Parachute System

For a safe landing (<5 m/s):
- Terminal velocity calculation: v = sqrt(2mg/ρACd)
- For ~3-4kg rocket, we need cd_s ≈ 1.5-2.0 m²

## Launch Configuration

- Inclination: Slightly angled (88°) away from wind direction
- Heading: 270° (West) to counteract the 5 m/s easterly wind

## Final Design

            "bottom_radius": 0.08, # Same as body radius
            "material": "balsa_wood",
        },
    },

            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.4,  # Small drogue for stability
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,

    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.2,  # 1.2m launch rail
        "inclination": 88,   # Slight angle to compensate for wind

        "mass": 0.25,  # 250g payload
        "position": 0.3  # Positioned toward the nose
    }
}
```

This design balances:
1. Sufficient impulse to reach target apogee with the Pro75M1670 motor
2. Low cost through extensive use of balsa wood
3. Safe landing velocity with appropriately sized parachute
4. Structural integrity with appropriate materials and thickness
5. Wind compensation through launch angle and heading

The lightweight construction with balsa wood reduces overall mass, allowing the Pro75M1670 motor to provide sufficient impulse to reach our target altitude while keeping costs down. The parachute system is sized to ensure a safe landing under 5 m/s.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

I'll approach this design systematically, learning from the previous attempts. The first attempt with AeroTechK700W reached only 2221.74m (27.11% short), while the second attempt with Pro75M1670 reached 2512.16m (17.58% short) but had structural failure issues due to the balsa wood construction.

## Motor Selection Analysis

Looking at the previous attempts and available motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Radius (mm) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 75 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 54 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 75 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 161 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 150 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 54 |

The Pro75M1670 got us closer but still fell short. We need more impulse, but the larger motors (O-class) would likely overshoot our target significantly. The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse as Pro75M1670 but is heavier, which would reduce our apogee. Let's try using the Pro75M1670 again but with a more optimized design.

## Structural Considerations

The second attempt failed structurally with balsa wood. We need stronger materials while keeping weight reasonable:
- Fiberglass offers good strength-to-weight ratio at moderate cost
- Carbon fiber is strongest but most expensive
- Plywood is stronger than balsa but still relatively lightweight

## Body Design Optimization

- Body radius: 0.08m (slightly larger than the 75mm motor)
- Material: Fiberglass for structural integrity
- Length: Optimized to balance stability and weight

## Aerodynamics

- Nose cone: Ogive shape for good aerodynamic performance
- Fins: 4 fins for better stability with fiberglass construction
- Reduced fin size to minimize drag while maintaining stability

## Parachute System

For a safe landing (<5 m/s):
- For a ~3kg rocket: v = sqrt(2mg/ρACd)
- Need cd_s ≈ 1.5-2.0 m²

## Launch Configuration

- Inclination: 89° (nearly vertical for maximum altitude)
- Heading: 270° (West) to counteract the 5 m/s easterly wind

## Weight Reduction Strategy

To reach our target altitude with the Pro75M1670 motor:
1. Use thinner walls where possible
2. Optimize component dimensions
3. Reduce payload mass slightly

        "mass": 0.2,  # 200g payload

```

This design addresses the issues from previous attempts:

1. **Structural Integrity**: Using fiberglass instead of balsa wood for all components ensures the rocket won't fail structurally during flight.

2. **Weight Optimization**: Reduced wall thickness, component dimensions, and payload mass to improve altitude performance with the Pro75M1670 motor.

3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Streamlined design with optimized fin configuration for stability with minimal drag.

4. **Launch Configuration**: Nearly vertical launch (89°) to maximize altitude potential while still accounting for wind.

5. **Cost Consideration**: Fiberglass offers a good balance between strength and cost compared to carbon fiber.

6. **Safe Landing**: Parachute sized appropriately for a safe landing velocity under 5 m/s.

The Pro75M1670 motor with this optimized, lightweight fiberglass construction should provide sufficient impulse to reach our target altitude of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity throughout the flight.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

Looking at the previous attempts, I can see a clear progression in performance:
- Attempt 1 (AeroTechK700W): 2221.74m (27.11% short), passed structural tests, low cost ($236.79)
- Attempt 2 (Pro75M1670 with balsa): 2512.16m (17.58% short), failed structural tests, moderate cost ($521.35)
- Attempt 3 (Pro75M1670 with fiberglass): 2809.61m (7.82% short), passed structural tests, higher cost ($594.10)

The trend shows we're getting closer to our target apogee, but still falling short. Let's optimize further to reach exactly 3048m.

## Motor Selection Refinement

The Pro75M1670 motor has gotten us closest to our target. We need approximately 8% more altitude, which we can achieve through further design optimization rather than switching to a much more powerful motor.

## Weight and Drag Optimization

To increase our apogee with the same motor:
1. Further reduce weight where possible
2. Minimize drag through aerodynamic refinements
3. Optimize the center of gravity and center of pressure relationship

## Material Selection

Fiberglass provided sufficient structural integrity in attempt 3. For critical components, we'll keep fiberglass, but we can use lighter materials like ABS plastic for non-critical components to reduce weight.

## Detailed Calculations

For a rocket to reach 3048m with the Pro75M1670 motor:
- Total impulse available: 6023.6 Ns
- Estimated rocket mass (without motor): ~1.5kg
- Total mass with motor: ~3.3kg
- Drag coefficient target: minimize to CD < 0.5

To increase our altitude by ~8%, we need to:
- Reduce overall mass by ~5-10%
- Reduce drag by optimizing fin design and nose cone
- Adjust launch angle slightly to account for wind

}
```

## Design Rationale

1. **Motor**: Kept the Pro75M1670 as it's gotten us closest to our target altitude.

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Reduced body length from 0.8m to 0.75m
   - Decreased wall thickness from 2.5mm to 2.2mm
   - Reduced fin count from 4 to 3
   - Decreased tail length from 10cm to 8cm
   - Reduced payload mass from 200g to 150g
   - Used lighter ABS plastic for the tail section

3. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Changed nose cone from ogive to von Karman shape for better supersonic performance
   - Optimized fin dimensions (smaller area)
   - Reduced body radius slightly from 80mm to 78mm

4. **Structural Integrity**:
   - Maintained fiberglass for critical components (body, nose cone, fins)
   - Kept sufficient thickness to prevent structural failure

5. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Increased rail length from 1.2m to 1.3m for better initial stability
   - Maintained 88° inclination to account for wind drift

6. **Parachute System**:
   - Slightly reduced parachute sizes while ensuring safe landing velocity

These optimizations should provide the additional 8% altitude needed to reach our target of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity, minimizing cost, and ensuring a safe landing.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

Looking at the progression of previous attempts, I can see we're getting closer to our target apogee but still falling short. Let me analyze the data and make further optimizations to reach exactly 3048m.

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

| Attempt | Motor | Actual Apogee | Error | Structure | Cost |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------|-----------|------|
| 1 | AeroTechK700W | 2221.74m | 27.11% | PASSED | $236.79 |
| 2 | Pro75M1670 with balsa | 2512.16m | 17.58% | FAILED | $521.35 |
| 3 | Pro75M1670 with fiberglass | 2809.61m | 7.82% | PASSED | $594.10 |
| 4 | Pro75M1670 optimized | 2869.81m | 5.85% | PASSED | $587.92 |

The trend shows we're getting closer with each iteration using the Pro75M1670 motor. We need approximately 6% more altitude to reach our target.

## Motor Selection Refinement

The CesaroniM1670 has the same total impulse (6023.6 Ns) as the Pro75M1670 but is heavier (3.101kg vs 1.815kg). This suggests that the Pro75M1670 is more efficient for our purposes. Let's continue with this motor but make further optimizations.

## Thrust-to-Weight Ratio Analysis

For optimal performance, we need a good initial thrust-to-weight ratio:
- Pro75M1670 max thrust: 2200N
- Estimated rocket mass: ~3kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 2200N / (3kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 75

This is more than adequate for a stable launch.

## Weight and Drag Optimization Strategy

To increase our apogee by ~6%:
1. Further reduce weight through material selection and component sizing
2. Optimize aerodynamics to minimize drag
3. Fine-tune launch parameters

## Detailed Design Calculations

For a rocket to reach exactly 3048m with the Pro75M1670 motor:
- We need to reduce overall mass by ~3-5% from our previous design
- Optimize fin design for minimal drag while maintaining stability
- Use a more aerodynamic nose cone shape
- Adjust launch angle to maximize vertical component of velocity

}
```

## Design Rationale

1. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Further reduced body length from 0.75m to 0.72m
   - Decreased wall thickness from 2.2mm to 2.0mm
   - Optimized fin dimensions (smaller area)
   - Reduced tail length from 8cm to 7cm
   - Reduced payload mass from 150g to 120g
   - Used carbon fiber for fins which offers better strength-to-weight ratio

2. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Maintained von Karman nose cone shape but increased length from 25cm to 28cm for better aerodynamic performance
   - Further reduced fin size while maintaining stability
   - Reduced body radius slightly from 78mm to 77mm

3. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Increased rail length from 1.3m to 1.4m for better initial stability
   - Adjusted inclination to 89.5° (nearly vertical) to maximize altitude

4. **Structural Integrity**:
   - Used carbon fiber for fins to maintain strength while reducing weight
   - Maintained fiberglass for body and nose cone
   - Kept sufficient thickness to prevent structural failure

5. **Parachute System**:
   - Slightly reduced parachute sizes while ensuring safe landing velocity

These optimizations should provide the additional 6% altitude needed to reach our target of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity, minimizing cost where possible, and ensuring a safe landing. The use of carbon fiber for fins adds some cost but provides significant weight savings where it matters most for stability.
