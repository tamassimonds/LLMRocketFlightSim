# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

Looking at the progression of previous attempts, I can see we're getting closer to our target apogee with each iteration. Let me analyze the data and make further optimizations to reach exactly 3048m.

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

| Attempt | Motor | Actual Apogee | Error | Structure | Cost |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------|-----------|------|
| 1 | AeroTechK700W | 2221.74m | 27.11% | PASSED | $236.79 |
| 2 | Pro75M1670 with balsa | 2512.16m | 17.58% | FAILED | $521.35 |
| 3 | Pro75M1670 with fiberglass | 2809.61m | 7.82% | PASSED | $594.10 |
| 4 | Pro75M1670 optimized | 2869.81m | 5.85% | PASSED | $587.92 |
| 5 | Pro75M1670 further optimized | 2932.45m | 3.79% | PASSED | $589.88 |

We're now within 3.79% of our target apogee. The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently improved our performance with each design iteration. We need approximately 4% more altitude to reach our target.

## Thrust-to-Weight Ratio and Impulse Analysis

The Pro75M1670 motor has been getting us closer to our target with each optimization. Let's analyze the CesaroniM1670 as an alternative:
- Both have the same total impulse (6023.6 Ns)
- CesaroniM1670 is heavier (3.101kg vs 1.815kg for Pro75M1670)
- Pro75M1670 has slightly longer burn time (3.9s vs 3.6s)

The Pro75M1670 remains the better choice due to its lower weight.

## Final Design Optimization Strategy

To increase our apogee by the remaining ~4%:
1. Further reduce weight through material optimization
2. Refine aerodynamics for minimal drag
3. Optimize launch parameters for maximum altitude
4. Consider slightly reducing parachute size while maintaining safe landing

## Design Rationale

1. **Material Upgrade**:
   - Switched body and nose cone from fiberglass to carbon fiber for significant weight reduction while maintaining strength
   - This is the most significant change from previous designs and should provide the needed performance boost

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Further reduced body length from 0.72m to 0.68m
   - Decreased wall thickness from 2.0mm to 1.8mm
   - Further optimized fin dimensions
   - Reduced tail length from 7cm to 6cm
   - Reduced payload mass from 120g to 100g

3. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Increased nose cone length from 28cm to 30cm for better aerodynamic performance
   - Further reduced fin size while maintaining stability
   - Reduced body radius slightly from 77mm to 76mm

4. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Increased rail length from 1.4m to 1.5m for better initial stability
   - Set inclination to exactly 90° (vertical) to maximize altitude

5. **Parachute System**:
   - Slightly reduced parachute sizes while ensuring safe landing velocity

The use of carbon fiber for the main components (body, nose cone, fins) represents a significant upgrade from previous designs. While this adds some cost, the substantial weight reduction should provide the additional 4% altitude needed to reach our target of 3048m. Carbon fiber offers approximately 30-40% weight savings compared to fiberglass with equal or better strength, which is exactly what we need for this final optimization.

The combination of these refinements—particularly the material upgrade to carbon fiber—should allow us to reach our target apogee of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity and ensuring a safe landing.
