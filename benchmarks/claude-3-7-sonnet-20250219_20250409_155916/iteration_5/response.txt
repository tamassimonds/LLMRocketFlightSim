# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Analyzing the four previous attempts reveals important insights:

1. **First attempt**: AeroTechK700W motor - Failed structurally, reached only 2194.76m (27.99% error)
2. **Second attempt**: Pro75M1670 with carbon fiber - Passed structural tests, reached 2672.04m (12.33% error), expensive ($857.43)
3. **Third attempt**: Pro75M1670 with fiberglass/plywood - Passed structural tests, reached 2801.12m (8.10% error), lower cost ($602.32)
4. **Fourth attempt**: Pro75M1670 with thinner walls and balsa wood fins - Failed structurally, reached 2852.72m (6.41% error)

The key lesson is that we need to balance structural integrity with performance. The third attempt was structurally sound but undershot the apogee, while the fourth attempt got closer to the target but failed structurally due to material thinning.

## Refined Design Strategy

I'll use the Pro75M1670 motor which has proven to be appropriate for our target apogee, but make these critical adjustments:

1. **Maintain structural integrity**: Return to the material thicknesses that passed structural tests
2. **Increase altitude slightly**: Make targeted aerodynamic improvements
3. **Optimize for cost**: Use cost-effective materials that still provide adequate strength

## Material and Thickness Selection

- **Body**: Fiberglass with 0.003m thickness (proven to be structurally sound in attempt #3)
- **Nose cone**: Fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio)
- **Fins**: Plywood (balsa wood failed structurally in attempt #4)
- **Tail**: Fiberglass (consistent with body)

## Aerodynamic Optimizations

To increase altitude without compromising structural integrity:
- **Nose cone**: Longer, more aerodynamic shape (0.26m)
- **Body radius**: Slightly reduced to 0.079m (still provides clearance for motor)
- **Fin design**: Optimized for stability with minimal drag
- **Launch angle**: Adjusted to 85° to compensate for wind and maximize vertical component

## Recovery System Calculation

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s) with estimated mass of 2.9 kg:
```
Terminal velocity = sqrt(2*m*g/(ρ*Cd*A))
5 m/s = sqrt(2*2.9*9.81/(1.225*0.8*A))
A = 2*2.9*9.81/(1.225*0.8*5²) ≈ 1.16 m²
```

So Cd*A (cd_s) should be approximately 0.93 for the main parachute.

This design carefully balances the lessons learned from all previous attempts:

1. **Structural Integrity**: 
   - Returned to the 0.003m body wall thickness that passed structural tests
   - Used plywood instead of balsa wood for fins
   - Increased fin thickness to 0.004m

2. **Altitude Optimization**:
   - Longer, more aerodynamic nose cone (0.26m)
   - Slightly reduced body radius while maintaining structural integrity
   - Optimized fin design for stability with minimal drag
   - Adjusted launch angle to maximize vertical component

3. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Maintained use of fiberglass instead of more expensive carbon fiber
   - Used plywood for fins (good balance of strength and cost)
   - Kept overall dimensions modest

4. **Recovery System**:
   - Properly sized parachute for safe landing under 5 m/s
   - Balanced drogue size for initial descent control

This design represents a careful refinement based on empirical data from previous attempts, focusing on the critical balance between structural integrity, performance, and cost efficiency to maximize the overall score.
