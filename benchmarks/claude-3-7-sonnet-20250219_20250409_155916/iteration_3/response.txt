# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Design Approach

Looking at the previous attempts, I see that the first design with AeroTechK700W failed structurally and didn't reach the target apogee. The second design with Pro75M1670 and carbon fiber construction was structurally sound but still undershot the apogee by 12.33% and was quite expensive at $857.43.

I'll refine the approach to optimize for all scoring criteria: apogee accuracy, cost efficiency, structural integrity, landing speed, and horizontal distance.

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

The Pro75M1670 motor got us closer to the target apogee but still fell short. Let's analyze our options again:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium | Same impulse as Pro75M1670 but heavier |
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | Medium | Good impulse-to-weight ratio |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 0.732 | Low | Insufficient impulse for our target |

I'll stick with the Pro75M1670 motor but optimize the rest of the design to reduce weight and drag, which should help us reach the target apogee. The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse but is heavier, which would reduce our maximum altitude.

## Material Selection Optimization

Carbon fiber is strong but expensive. Let's consider alternatives that maintain structural integrity but reduce cost:

- Body: Fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio, lower cost than carbon fiber)
- Nose cone: Fiberglass (aerodynamically important, needs strength)
- Fins: Plywood (good strength, much cheaper than carbon fiber)
- Tail: Fiberglass (consistent with body material)

## Weight Reduction Strategy

To increase our apogee:
1. Reduce wall thickness where possible
2. Optimize fin dimensions
3. Streamline overall design

## Refined Altitude Estimation

For Pro75M1670 with 6023.6 Ns and estimated reduced mass of ~3.0 kg:
```
h ≈ (6023.6)²/(2 * 3.0 * 9.81) ≈ 6150m
```

This rough estimate is still higher than our target, giving us margin for drag losses. We need to carefully balance the design to hit our 3048m target.

## Body Dimensions Refinement

For the Pro75M1670 motor (75mm = 0.075m radius):
- Body radius: 0.08m (provides 5mm clearance around motor)
- Body length: 0.85m (slightly shorter than previous design)
- Wall thickness: 0.003m (reduced from previous 0.004m)

## Aerodynamic Considerations

- Nose cone: Ogive shape (good aerodynamic performance)
- Fins: 3 fins instead of 4 (reduces drag and weight while maintaining stability)
- Fin dimensions: Slightly reduced from previous design

## Recovery System Adjustment

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s) with estimated mass of 3.0 kg:
```
Terminal velocity = sqrt(2*m*g/(ρ*Cd*A))
5 m/s = sqrt(2*3.0*9.81/(1.225*0.8*A))
A = 2*3.0*9.81/(1.225*0.8*5²) ≈ 1.2 m²
```

So Cd*A (cd_s) should be approximately 0.96 for the main parachute.

## Wind Compensation

With a 5 m/s easterly wind, I'll adjust the launch angle:
- Inclination: 87° (slightly angled against wind)
- Heading: 270° (west, opposite to the easterly wind)

```

This optimized design addresses the issues from previous attempts:

1. **Material Selection**: Using fiberglass and plywood significantly reduces cost compared to carbon fiber while maintaining structural integrity
2. **Weight Optimization**: Reduced wall thickness, fewer fins, and slightly smaller dimensions to improve altitude performance
3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Maintained ogive nose cone but streamlined other components
4. **Recovery System**: Properly sized for safe landing under 5 m/s
5. **Launch Configuration**: Adjusted for wind conditions

The design balances all scoring criteria:
- Should reach closer to the target apogee of 3048m
- Significantly lower cost than the previous carbon fiber design
- Maintains structural integrity with appropriate materials and thicknesses
- Ensures safe landing with properly sized parachute
- Accounts for wind to minimize horizontal distance from launch site

This design represents a better balance between performance and cost, which should improve the overall score.
