After carefully analyzing all previous attempts, I'll design an optimized rocket that combines the best-performing elements while addressing the remaining performance gap. Here's my improved approach:

### Key Learnings:
1. **Best Performance**: Attempt 3 scored 80.92 with 8.52% apogee error
2. **Structural Success**: Fiberglass body at 0.0035m thickness worked reliably
3. **Aerodynamics**: Ogive nose at 0.45m length performed best
4. **Cost Efficiency**: $720-$730 range is optimal
5. **Remaining Gap**: Need to reduce the ~8% altitude deficit

### Optimized Strategy:
1. **Motor**: Keep Pro75M1670 (best available option)
2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Slightly shorter body (1.28m)
   - Optimized fin dimensions
   - Reduced payload (0.3kg)
3. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Maintain ogive nose but extend to 0.49m
   - 4 fins with reduced area but increased cant (1°)
4. **Structure**:
   - Fiberglass body (0.0035m)
   - Carbon fiber fins (0.004m)
5. **Recovery**:
   - Slightly smaller parachutes (still safe)
6. **Cost**:
   - Maintain ~$725 cost

### Final Optimized Design:

            "tip_chord": 0.11,

    },

            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.18,

    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 2.2,
        "inclination": 90,
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,
        "position": 0.67,
    },
}
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Longer nose cone (0.49m) for better drag reduction
   - Increased fin cant angle (1°) for improved stability in crosswinds
   - Optimized fin area to balance drag and stability

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Shorter body (1.28m) reduces mass
   - Smaller payload (0.3kg)
   - Maintained structural integrity

3. **Performance**:
   - Expected to reduce apogee error to ~7-8%
   - Maintains structural safety
   - Conservative recovery parameters

4. **Cost**:
   - Maintains cost around $725
   - Uses carbon fiber only where most effective

This design represents the optimal balance based on all empirical data from previous attempts, making carefully calculated improvements to the best-performing configuration while maintaining all safety and structural requirements.
