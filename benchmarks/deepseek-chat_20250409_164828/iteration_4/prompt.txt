# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
Alright, let's tackle this rocket design step by step. I'm going to think like a rocket scientist to come up with a design that meets all the requirements while optimizing for the scoring criteria.

### Understanding the Requirements

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters (10,000 feet)
2. **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from the East
3. **Scoring Criteria**:
   - Distance to max apogee (closer to 3048m is better)
   - Cost (cheaper is better)
   - Safe landing (impact velocity < 5 m/s)
   - No structural failure
   - Horizontal distance from launch site (closer is better)

### Motor Selection

First, let's pick a motor that can get us to around 3048 meters. We'll need to estimate the impulse required.

- **Total Impulse Needed**: For a medium-sized rocket to reach ~3000m, we're looking at a high-power motor, likely in the "M" or "N" class (but our options are limited to the given motors).
  
Looking at the motors:
- **Pro75M1670**: Total Impulse = 6023.6 Ns
- **CesaroniM1670**: Similar to Pro75M1670
- **CesaroniO3700**: 29930.2 Ns (too powerful)
- **CesaroniO5800**: 30382.7 Ns (too powerful)
- **AeroTechK700W**: 2249 Ns (likely too small)
- **AeroTechH128W**: 176.5 Ns (way too small)
- **CesaroniK160**: 1521.7 Ns (too small)

Between Pro75M1670 and CesaroniM1670, they're similar but Pro75M1670 has a slightly lower dry mass (1.815 kg vs 3.101 kg), so it's cheaper and lighter. Let's go with **Pro75M1670**.

### Rocket Body Design

- **Motor Radius**: 75 mm = 0.075 m
- **Body Radius**: Must be > motor radius. Let's choose 0.08 m (80 mm).
- **Length**: Need enough length to house the motor and provide stability. Motor length is 757 mm = 0.757 m. Let's add some space for payload and recovery, say total body length = 1.5 m.
- **Material**: Need something strong but not too expensive. **Fiberglass** is a good balance between strength and cost.
- **Thickness**: For fiberglass, ~0.003 m (3 mm) should be sufficient for this size.

### Nose Cone

- **Shape**: "ogive" is a good compromise between aerodynamics and ease of manufacturing.
- **Length**: Typically 2-3 times body diameter. Body diameter = 0.16 m, so nose cone length = 0.4 m.
- **Material**: "composite" for strength and lightweight.

### Fins

- **Number**: 4 fins for stability.
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Root chord: ~20% of body length = 0.3 m
  - Tip chord: half of root chord = 0.15 m
  - Span: ~body radius = 0.15 m
- **Cant Angle**: Small angle for stability, say 1 degree.
- **Material**: "carbon_fiber" for strength and lightweight.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m (5 mm).

### Tail

- **Length**: ~same as body length = 1.5 m (but this seems too long; maybe 0.3 m).
- **Top Radius**: Slightly less than body radius, say 0.07 m.
- **Bottom Radius**: Must be different from top, say 0.075 m.
- **Material**: "carbon_fiber".

### Parachutes

Need two: main and drogue for safe descent.

- **Drogue**:
  - Deployed at apogee to slow descent initially.
  - Cd_s (drag coefficient * area): Let's choose 0.2 m².
- **Main**:
  - Deployed at lower altitude for final descent.
  - Cd_s: Larger, say 0.5 m², to ensure landing speed < 5 m/s.

### Launch Rail

- **Length**: Typically 1.5 times rocket length. Rocket length ~ body + nose = 1.5 + 0.4 = 1.9 m, so rail length = 2.5 m.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees (vertical) to minimize horizontal drift.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees (straight up).

### Payload

- **Mass**: Let's assume 0.5 kg for instrumentation.
- **Position**: Near the nose, say 0.8 m from the center (since total length is ~1.9 m).

### Cost Considerations

- Motor: Pro75M1670 is relatively expensive but necessary for altitude.
- Materials: Fiberglass and carbon fiber are mid-range in cost.
- Avoid over-engineering to keep costs down.

### Final Design

Here's the Python dictionary representing the design:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "Pro75M1670",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.08,
        "length": 1.5,
        "material": "fiberglass",
        "thickness": 0.003,
    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {
            "kind": "ogive",
            "length": 0.4,
            "material": "composite",
        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 4,
            "root_chord": 0.3,
            "tip_chord": 0.15,
            "span": 0.15,
            "cant_angle": 1,
            "material": "carbon_fiber",
            "thickness": 0.005,
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.3,
            "top_radius": 0.07,
            "bottom_radius": 0.075,
            "material": "carbon_fiber",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.5,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.2,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 2.5,
        "inclination": 90,
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.5,
        "position": 0.8,
    },
}
```

### Rationale

1. **Motor**: Pro75M1670 provides sufficient impulse to reach ~3000m without being overly powerful (and expensive).
2. **Body**: Sized to fit the motor with some margin; fiberglass is cost-effective and strong.
3. **Nose Cone**: Ogive shape for good aerodynamics; composite material for strength.
4. **Fins**: Carbon fiber for lightweight strength; dimensions chosen for stability.
5. **Parachutes**: Sized to ensure safe landing speed (<5 m/s).
6. **Launch**: Vertical to minimize wind drift; long enough rail for stability off the pad.
7. **Payload**: Reasonable mass and position near the nose for balance.

This design balances performance, cost, and safety to maximize the score based on the given criteria.
Score: 80.71/100
Target Apogee: 3048.0m, Actual: 2804.03m, Error: 8.00%
Structural integrity: PASSED
Cost: $750.81

--- ATTEMPT 2 ---
Design:
To improve the rocket design, let's analyze the shortcomings of the previous attempt and make targeted adjustments:

### Analysis of Previous Design (Score: 80.71)
1. **Apogee Miss**: Fell short by 8% (2804m vs 3048m target)
2. **Cost**: $750.81 (room for optimization)
3. **Structural Integrity**: Passed (good)
4. **Landing**: Assumed passed (no velocity given)
5. **Horizontal Distance**: Not specified but likely acceptable

### Key Improvements Needed:
1. **Increase Altitude**:
   - Previous motor (Pro75M1670) didn't provide enough impulse
   - Upgrade to CesaroniM1670 (same impulse but heavier) won't help
   - Next option is CesaroniO3700 (29930 Ns vs 6023 Ns) - too powerful
   - Alternative: Optimize weight and drag to get more from Pro75M1670

2. **Reduce Cost**:
   - Replace carbon fiber with cheaper materials where possible
   - Reduce unnecessary mass

3. **Aerodynamic Improvements**:
   - Longer nose cone for better drag reduction
   - Smaller fins to reduce drag while maintaining stability

### Revised Design Calculations:

1. **Motor**: Keep Pro75M1670 (best balance for cost/performance)
   - To gain altitude: reduce rocket mass by 15-20%

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Body: Switch to thinner aluminum (0.002m) instead of fiberglass
   - Fins: Switch to fiberglass instead of carbon fiber
   - Nose: Keep composite (needed for strength)

3. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Increase nose cone length to 0.5m (more streamlined)
   - Reduce fin size (root chord 0.2m, tip 0.1m, span 0.1m)
   - Keep 4 fins but with 0.5° cant angle

4. **Parachutes**:
   - Reduce main chute to 0.4 m² (still safe for landing)
   - Keep drogue at 0.2 m²

5. **Payload**:
   - Reduce to 0.3 kg (lighter instrumentation)

### Improved Design:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "Pro75M1670",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.08,
        "length": 1.4,  # Reduced length
        "material": "aluminum",  # Cheaper than fiberglass

    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {

            "span": 0.1,
            "cant_angle": 0.5,  # Reduced cant angle
            "material": "fiberglass",  # Cheaper than carbon fiber
            "thickness": 0.004,
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.25,
            "top_radius": 0.07,
            "bottom_radius": 0.075,
            "material": "fiberglass",  # Cheaper material
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.4,  # Slightly smaller
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.2,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 2.3,  # Slightly shorter
        "inclination": 90,
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # Reduced payload
        "position": 0.7,
    },
}
```

### Expected Improvements:
1. **Altitude**: Reduced mass and improved aerodynamics should get closer to 3048m
2. **Cost**: Aluminum body and fiberglass fins reduce cost significantly
3. **Safety**: Maintained adequate parachute sizes for safe landing
4. **Stability**: Smaller fins but sufficient for this rocket size

This design should score higher by:
- Getting closer to target apogee (better distance_reward)
- Lower cost (better cost_reward)
- Maintaining all safety/structure requirements
Score: 74.03/100
Target Apogee: 3048.0m, Actual: 2839.02m, Error: 6.86%
Structural integrity: FAILED
Cost: $658.89

--- ATTEMPT 3 ---
Design:
Let me analyze the previous attempts and design an improved rocket that addresses their shortcomings while optimizing for all scoring criteria.

Key Learnings from Previous Attempts:
1. Attempt 1 (Score: 80.71)
- Underperformed apogee by 8% (2804m vs 3048m)
- Structural integrity passed
- Cost was $750.81

2. Attempt 2 (Score: 74.03)
- Improved apogee error to 6.86% (2839m)
- Structural failure occurred (likely due to thinner aluminum body)
- Lower cost ($658.89)

Optimization Strategy:
1. Motor Selection:
- Stick with Pro75M1670 (best balance for target altitude)
- Avoid heavier motors that would require more structural reinforcement

2. Structural Integrity:
- Return to fiberglass body (thicker than Attempt 2)
- Keep composite nose cone
- Use carbon fiber for critical stress points (fins)

3. Weight Optimization:
- Slightly reduce body length (1.3m vs 1.5m)
- Optimize fin size for stability without excess weight
- Moderate payload mass (0.4kg)

4. Aerodynamics:
- Longer ogive nose cone (0.45m)
- Carefully sized fins for stability
- Proper tail configuration

5. Cost Control:
- Balance material choices (fiberglass body, carbon fiber fins)
- Avoid over-engineering

Improved Design:

Design Rationale:

1. Motor: Maintained Pro75M1670 as it's the most appropriate impulse class
2. Structure:
- Fiberglass body with 3.5mm thickness ensures strength
- Carbon fiber fins provide necessary stability
- Optimized dimensions reduce weight while maintaining integrity

3. Aerodynamics:
- Longer nose cone (0.45m) reduces drag
- Carefully sized fins (smaller than Attempt 1 but larger than Attempt 2)
- Proper tail configuration ensures smooth airflow

4. Recovery:
- Slightly reduced parachute sizes (still safe) to minimize weight
- Maintained two-chute system for reliability

5. Cost:
- Balanced material choices to stay mid-range
- Avoided unnecessary over-engineering

Expected Improvements:
- Should reach closer to target apogee (reduced error)
- Maintain structural integrity
- Keep costs reasonable
- Ensure safe landing
- Minimize horizontal drift

This design carefully balances all scoring factors based on lessons from previous attempts.
Score: 80.92/100
Target Apogee: 3048.0m, Actual: 2788.24m, Error: 8.52%
Structural integrity: PASSED
Cost: $722.49
