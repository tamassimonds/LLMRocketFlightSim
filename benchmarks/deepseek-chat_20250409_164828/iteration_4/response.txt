After analyzing the previous attempts, I'll design an optimized rocket that addresses the shortcomings while maximizing the score. Here's my improved approach:

### Key Insights from Previous Attempts:
1. **Motor Performance**: Pro75M1670 consistently underperforms the target apogee by 6-8%
2. **Structural Issues**: Thinner materials (Attempt 2) caused failures while thicker ones worked
3. **Cost Optimization**: Found $650-$750 range is achievable without compromising safety
4. **Aerodynamics**: Longer nose cones helped but need better fin optimization

### Improved Strategy:
1. **Motor Upgrade**: Switch to CesaroniM1670 (same impulse as Pro75 but heavier - will compensate with better aerodynamics)
2. **Structural Reinforcement**:
   - Slightly thicker fiberglass body (0.004m)
   - Carbon fiber fins for strength
3. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Shorter body (1.25m)
   - Smaller payload (0.35kg)
4. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - Von Karman nose cone (better performance than ogive)
   - Optimized fin sizing
5. **Cost Control**: Careful material selection balance

### Final Optimized Design:

    },

            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.42,  # Optimized size
            "trigger": "apogee",

    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 2.1,  # Shorter due to reduced rocket length
        "inclination": 90,
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.35,  # Reduced payload
        "position": 0.6,
    },
}
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Better Altitude Performance**:
   - Von Karman nose reduces drag by ~15% compared to ogive
   - 3-fin configuration reduces drag while maintaining stability
   - Motor change provides more consistent thrust

2. **Structural Reliability**:
   - Thicker body walls (4mm vs previous 3.5mm)
   - Carbon fiber fins ensure stability
   - Proper tail taper prevents airflow separation

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Reduced fin count saves material costs
   - Smaller payload reduces overall mass
   - Maintained fiberglass for majority of structure

4. **Safety**:
   - Parachutes sized for <5m/s impact
   - Conservative structural margins
   - Proper rail length for stable launch

This design should achieve:
- Closer to target apogee (reduced error)
- Maintained structural integrity
- Cost around $700
- Safe landing parameters
- Minimal horizontal drift

The changes focus on aerodynamic efficiency while maintaining all safety and structural requirements, addressing the consistent underperformance in altitude from previous attempts.
