After carefully analyzing all previous attempts, I'll design an optimized rocket that combines the best-performing elements while making targeted improvements to address the remaining performance gap. Here's my comprehensive approach:

### Key Insights from All Attempts:
1. **Best Performance**: Attempt 3 scored 80.92 with 8.52% apogee error using:
   - Pro75M1670 motor
   - Fiberglass body (0.0035m)
   - Ogive nose cone (0.45m)
   - 4 carbon fiber fins

2. **Structural Lessons**: Thinner materials caused failures; 0.0035m fiberglass worked best
3. **Aerodynamics**: Longer nose cones helped, but von Karman underperformed
4. **Cost Efficiency**: $720-$730 range is optimal for scoring
5. **Remaining Challenge**: Need to reduce the ~8-10% altitude deficit

### Optimized Strategy:
1. **Motor Selection**: Stick with Pro75M1670 (best impulse/weight ratio)
2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Slightly shorter body (1.27m)
   - Optimized fin dimensions
   - Reduced payload (0.32kg)
3. **Aerodynamic Improvements**:
   - Extended ogive nose (0.5m)
   - 4 fins with increased span/chord ratio
   - Slightly increased cant angle (1.2°)
4. **Structural Integrity**:
   - Maintain fiberglass body at 0.0035m
   - Carbon fiber fins at 0.0042m thickness
5. **Recovery System**:
   - Balanced parachute sizes for safe landing
6. **Cost Control**:
   - Strategic material selection
   - Avoid over-engineering

### Key Improvements and Rationale:
1. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - Longer ogive nose (0.5m) reduces drag coefficient
   - Increased fin span improves stability in crosswinds
   - Slightly larger body radius improves fin attachment area

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Shorter body (1.27m) reduces mass without compromising structure
   - Optimized payload mass (0.32kg) balances needs and weight

3. **Structural Integrity**:
   - Maintained proven fiberglass thickness
   - Slightly thicker fins (0.0042m) ensure strength
   - Conservative tail design prevents airflow separation

4. **Performance Enhancements**:
   - Increased fin cant angle (1.2°) helps compensate for 5 m/s winds
   - Balanced fin dimensions provide stability without excess drag
   - Expected to reduce apogee error to ~7-8%

5. **Cost and Safety**:
   - Estimated cost ~$730 (optimal range)
   - Conservative parachute sizing ensures <5 m/s landing
   - Proper rail length for stable launch

This design represents the culmination of lessons learned from all previous attempts, making carefully calculated improvements to maximize the score while maintaining all safety and reliability requirements.
