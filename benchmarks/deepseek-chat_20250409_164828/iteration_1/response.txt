Alright, let's tackle this rocket design step by step. I'm going to think like a rocket scientist to come up with a design that meets all the requirements while optimizing for the scoring criteria.

### Understanding the Requirements

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters (10,000 feet)
2. **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from the East
3. **Scoring Criteria**:
   - Distance to max apogee (closer to 3048m is better)
   - Cost (cheaper is better)
   - Safe landing (impact velocity < 5 m/s)
   - No structural failure
   - Horizontal distance from launch site (closer is better)

### Motor Selection

First, let's pick a motor that can get us to around 3048 meters. We'll need to estimate the impulse required.

- **Total Impulse Needed**: For a medium-sized rocket to reach ~3000m, we're looking at a high-power motor, likely in the "M" or "N" class (but our options are limited to the given motors).
  
Looking at the motors:
- **Pro75M1670**: Total Impulse = 6023.6 Ns
- **CesaroniM1670**: Similar to Pro75M1670
- **CesaroniO3700**: 29930.2 Ns (too powerful)
- **CesaroniO5800**: 30382.7 Ns (too powerful)
- **AeroTechK700W**: 2249 Ns (likely too small)
- **AeroTechH128W**: 176.5 Ns (way too small)
- **CesaroniK160**: 1521.7 Ns (too small)

Between Pro75M1670 and CesaroniM1670, they're similar but Pro75M1670 has a slightly lower dry mass (1.815 kg vs 3.101 kg), so it's cheaper and lighter. Let's go with **Pro75M1670**.

### Rocket Body Design

- **Motor Radius**: 75 mm = 0.075 m
- **Body Radius**: Must be > motor radius. Let's choose 0.08 m (80 mm).
- **Length**: Need enough length to house the motor and provide stability. Motor length is 757 mm = 0.757 m. Let's add some space for payload and recovery, say total body length = 1.5 m.
- **Material**: Need something strong but not too expensive. **Fiberglass** is a good balance between strength and cost.
- **Thickness**: For fiberglass, ~0.003 m (3 mm) should be sufficient for this size.

### Nose Cone

- **Shape**: "ogive" is a good compromise between aerodynamics and ease of manufacturing.
- **Length**: Typically 2-3 times body diameter. Body diameter = 0.16 m, so nose cone length = 0.4 m.
- **Material**: "composite" for strength and lightweight.

### Fins

- **Number**: 4 fins for stability.
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Root chord: ~20% of body length = 0.3 m
  - Tip chord: half of root chord = 0.15 m
  - Span: ~body radius = 0.15 m
- **Cant Angle**: Small angle for stability, say 1 degree.
- **Material**: "carbon_fiber" for strength and lightweight.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m (5 mm).

### Tail

- **Length**: ~same as body length = 1.5 m (but this seems too long; maybe 0.3 m).
- **Top Radius**: Slightly less than body radius, say 0.07 m.
- **Bottom Radius**: Must be different from top, say 0.075 m.
- **Material**: "carbon_fiber".

### Parachutes

Need two: main and drogue for safe descent.

- **Drogue**:
  - Deployed at apogee to slow descent initially.
  - Cd_s (drag coefficient * area): Let's choose 0.2 m².
- **Main**:
  - Deployed at lower altitude for final descent.
  - Cd_s: Larger, say 0.5 m², to ensure landing speed < 5 m/s.

### Launch Rail

- **Length**: Typically 1.5 times rocket length. Rocket length ~ body + nose = 1.5 + 0.4 = 1.9 m, so rail length = 2.5 m.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees (vertical) to minimize horizontal drift.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees (straight up).

### Payload

- **Mass**: Let's assume 0.5 kg for instrumentation.
- **Position**: Near the nose, say 0.8 m from the center (since total length is ~1.9 m).

### Cost Considerations

- Motor: Pro75M1670 is relatively expensive but necessary for altitude.
- Materials: Fiberglass and carbon fiber are mid-range in cost.
- Avoid over-engineering to keep costs down.

### Final Design

### Rationale

1. **Motor**: Pro75M1670 provides sufficient impulse to reach ~3000m without being overly powerful (and expensive).
2. **Body**: Sized to fit the motor with some margin; fiberglass is cost-effective and strong.
3. **Nose Cone**: Ogive shape for good aerodynamics; composite material for strength.
4. **Fins**: Carbon fiber for lightweight strength; dimensions chosen for stability.
5. **Parachutes**: Sized to ensure safe landing speed (<5 m/s).
6. **Launch**: Vertical to minimize wind drift; long enough rail for stability off the pad.
7. **Payload**: Reasonable mass and position near the nose for balance.

This design balances performance, cost, and safety to maximize the score based on the given criteria.
