After carefully analyzing the previous attempts, I'll design an optimized rocket that addresses the key issues while maximizing the score. Here's my improved approach:

### Key Learnings:
1. **Motor Performance**: Pro75M1670 consistently underperformed (6-8% below target)
2. **Structural Issues**: Need balance between weight and strength
3. **Aerodynamics**: Von Karman nose performed poorly (24% error) - revert to ogive
4. **Cost**: Best balance around $700-$750

### Optimized Strategy:
1. **Motor Selection**: Stick with Pro75M1670 (best balance despite underperformance)
2. **Structural Design**:
   - Fiberglass body (0.0035m thickness) for strength/weight balance
   - Carbon fiber fins for stability
   - Conservative dimensions for reliability
3. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Ogive nose cone (0.45m length)
   - 4 fins for better stability in crosswinds
   - Optimized fin sizing
4. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Slightly shorter body (1.35m)
   - Moderate payload (0.4kg)
5. **Recovery**:
   - Conservative parachute sizing for safe landing
6. **Cost Control**:
   - Balanced material selection

### Final Optimized Design:

    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.4,
        "position": 0.7,
    },
}
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Reliable Performance**:
   - Conservative design based on best-performing previous attempt (80.92 score)
   - Maintains structural integrity while optimizing altitude
   - Proper fin sizing for stability in 5 m/s winds

2. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - Ogive nose cone (proven better than von Karman in tests)
   - 4 fins provide better stability than 3-fin configuration
   - Careful dimensioning to reduce drag

3. **Cost and Weight Balance**:
   - Fiberglass body with carbon fiber only where needed
   - Moderate payload mass
   - Expected cost around $730

4. **Safety**:
   - Adequate parachute sizes for <5 m/s landing
   - Sufficient rail length for stable launch
   - Conservative structural margins

This design should provide:
- Best apogee performance possible with given motor
- Reliable structural integrity
- Safe recovery
- Minimal horizontal drift
- Competitive cost

The design carefully balances all scoring factors based on empirical data from previous attempts, making only conservative, proven improvements.
