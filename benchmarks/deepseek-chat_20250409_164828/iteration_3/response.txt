Let me analyze the previous attempts and design an improved rocket that addresses their shortcomings while optimizing for all scoring criteria.

Key Learnings from Previous Attempts:
1. Attempt 1 (Score: 80.71)
- Underperformed apogee by 8% (2804m vs 3048m)
- Structural integrity passed
- Cost was $750.81

2. Attempt 2 (Score: 74.03)
- Improved apogee error to 6.86% (2839m)
- Structural failure occurred (likely due to thinner aluminum body)
- Lower cost ($658.89)

Optimization Strategy:
1. Motor Selection:
- Stick with Pro75M1670 (best balance for target altitude)
- Avoid heavier motors that would require more structural reinforcement

2. Structural Integrity:
- Return to fiberglass body (thicker than Attempt 2)
- Keep composite nose cone
- Use carbon fiber for critical stress points (fins)

3. Weight Optimization:
- Slightly reduce body length (1.3m vs 1.5m)
- Optimize fin size for stability without excess weight
- Moderate payload mass (0.4kg)

4. Aerodynamics:
- Longer ogive nose cone (0.45m)
- Carefully sized fins for stability
- Proper tail configuration

5. Cost Control:
- Balance material choices (fiberglass body, carbon fiber fins)
- Avoid over-engineering

Improved Design:

```

Design Rationale:

1. Motor: Maintained Pro75M1670 as it's the most appropriate impulse class
2. Structure:
- Fiberglass body with 3.5mm thickness ensures strength
- Carbon fiber fins provide necessary stability
- Optimized dimensions reduce weight while maintaining integrity

3. Aerodynamics:
- Longer nose cone (0.45m) reduces drag
- Carefully sized fins (smaller than Attempt 1 but larger than Attempt 2)
- Proper tail configuration ensures smooth airflow

4. Recovery:
- Slightly reduced parachute sizes (still safe) to minimize weight
- Maintained two-chute system for reliability

5. Cost:
- Balanced material choices to stay mid-range
- Avoided unnecessary over-engineering

Expected Improvements:
- Should reach closer to target apogee (reduced error)
- Maintain structural integrity
- Keep costs reasonable
- Ensure safe landing
- Minimize horizontal drift

This design carefully balances all scoring factors based on lessons from previous attempts.
