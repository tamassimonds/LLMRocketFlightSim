To improve the rocket design, let's analyze the shortcomings of the previous attempt and make targeted adjustments:

### Analysis of Previous Design (Score: 80.71)
1. **Apogee Miss**: Fell short by 8% (2804m vs 3048m target)
2. **Cost**: $750.81 (room for optimization)
3. **Structural Integrity**: Passed (good)
4. **Landing**: Assumed passed (no velocity given)
5. **Horizontal Distance**: Not specified but likely acceptable

### Key Improvements Needed:
1. **Increase Altitude**:
   - Previous motor (Pro75M1670) didn't provide enough impulse
   - Upgrade to CesaroniM1670 (same impulse but heavier) won't help
   - Next option is CesaroniO3700 (29930 Ns vs 6023 Ns) - too powerful
   - Alternative: Optimize weight and drag to get more from Pro75M1670

2. **Reduce Cost**:
   - Replace carbon fiber with cheaper materials where possible
   - Reduce unnecessary mass

3. **Aerodynamic Improvements**:
   - Longer nose cone for better drag reduction
   - Smaller fins to reduce drag while maintaining stability

### Revised Design Calculations:

1. **Motor**: Keep Pro75M1670 (best balance for cost/performance)
   - To gain altitude: reduce rocket mass by 15-20%

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Body: Switch to thinner aluminum (0.002m) instead of fiberglass
   - Fins: Switch to fiberglass instead of carbon fiber
   - Nose: Keep composite (needed for strength)

3. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Increase nose cone length to 0.5m (more streamlined)
   - Reduce fin size (root chord 0.2m, tip 0.1m, span 0.1m)
   - Keep 4 fins but with 0.5° cant angle

4. **Parachutes**:
   - Reduce main chute to 0.4 m² (still safe for landing)
   - Keep drogue at 0.2 m²

5. **Payload**:
   - Reduce to 0.3 kg (lighter instrumentation)

```

### Expected Improvements:
1. **Altitude**: Reduced mass and improved aerodynamics should get closer to 3048m
2. **Cost**: Aluminum body and fiberglass fins reduce cost significantly
3. **Safety**: Maintained adequate parachute sizes for safe landing
4. **Stability**: Smaller fins but sufficient for this rocket size

This design should score higher by:
- Getting closer to target apogee (better distance_reward)
- Lower cost (better cost_reward)
- Maintaining all safety/structure requirements
