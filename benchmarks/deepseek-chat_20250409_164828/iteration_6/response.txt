After carefully analyzing all previous attempts, I'll design an optimized rocket that combines the best-performing elements while addressing the shortcomings. Here's my improved approach:

### Key Insights from All Attempts:
1. **Best Score**: 80.92 (Attempt 3) with Pro75M1670 motor
2. **Structural Integrity**: Fiberglass body at 0.0035m thickness worked best
3. **Aerodynamics**: Ogive nose cone performed better than von Karman
4. **Cost**: $700-$750 range is optimal for score balance
5. **Altitude**: Need to close the 6-10% apogee gap from previous best

### Optimized Strategy:
1. **Motor**: Keep Pro75M1670 (best balance of cost/performance)
2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Slightly shorter body (1.3m vs 1.35m)
   - Optimized fin dimensions
   - Moderate payload (0.35kg)
3. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Longer ogive nose (0.48m)
   - 4 fins with optimized area
   - Careful tail design
4. **Structure**:
   - Fiberglass body (0.0035m)
   - Carbon fiber fins for strength
5. **Recovery**:
   - Conservative parachute sizing
6. **Cost**:
   - Balanced material selection

### Final Optimized Design:

    },
}
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - Longer nose cone (0.48m) reduces drag
   - Optimized fin dimensions (smaller than Attempt 3 but larger than Attempt 2)
   - Careful tail design for smooth airflow

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Shorter body (1.3m) reduces mass
   - Slightly smaller payload (0.35kg)
   - Thinner fins (0.004m) while maintaining strength

3. **Structural Integrity**:
   - Maintained fiberglass body at proven thickness
   - Carbon fiber fins for critical strength
   - Conservative dimensions throughout

4. **Cost Control**:
   - Balanced material selection
   - Avoided unnecessary over-engineering
   - Expected cost ~$710

5. **Performance**:
   - Should achieve closest apogee to target (reducing 10.62% error from best attempt)
   - Maintains all safety margins
   - Stable in 5 m/s winds

This design represents the optimal balance of all scoring factors based on empirical data from all previous attempts, making only carefully considered improvements to the best-performing configuration.
