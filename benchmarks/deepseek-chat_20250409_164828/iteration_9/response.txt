After carefully analyzing all previous attempts, I'll design an optimized rocket that combines the best-performing elements while making targeted improvements to maximize the score. Here's my comprehensive approach:

### Key Insights from All Attempts:
1. **Best Performance**: Attempt 3 scored 80.92 with:
   - Pro75M1670 motor
   - Fiberglass body (0.0035m)
   - Ogive nose cone (0.45m)
   - 4 carbon fiber fins
   - 8.52% apogee error

2. **Structural Lessons**: 0.0035m fiberglass thickness provided reliable performance
3. **Aerodynamics**: Ogive nose outperformed von Karman
4. **Cost Efficiency**: $720-$730 range is optimal
5. **Improvement Areas**: Need to reduce apogee error while maintaining other metrics

### Optimized Strategy:
1. **Motor**: Keep Pro75M1670 (best available option)
2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Slightly shorter body (1.26m)
   - Optimized fin dimensions
   - Reduced payload (0.3kg)
3. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Extended ogive nose (0.52m)
   - 4 fins with optimized area
   - Increased cant angle (1.5°) for wind stability
4. **Structure**:
   - Fiberglass body (0.0035m)
   - Carbon fiber fins (0.004m)
5. **Recovery**:
   - Conservative parachute sizing
6. **Cost**:
   - Strategic material selection

}
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Longer nose cone (0.52m) for better drag reduction
   - Increased fin cant angle (1.5°) for improved wind stability
   - Optimized fin dimensions for balance between stability and drag

2. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Shorter body (1.26m) reduces mass
   - Smaller payload (0.3kg)
   - Maintained structural integrity

3. **Performance**:
   - Expected to reduce apogee error to ~7-8%
   - Maintains structural safety
   - Conservative recovery parameters

4. **Cost**:
   - Estimated cost ~$720
   - Uses carbon fiber only where most effective

This design represents the optimal balance based on all empirical data from previous attempts, making carefully calculated improvements to maximize the score while maintaining all safety and structural requirements.
