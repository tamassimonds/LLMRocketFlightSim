To design a rocket aimed at reaching the target apogee of 3048 meters while accounting for safety, structural integrity, costs, and wind conditions, I will streamline my design choices based on previous attempts as well as fundamental principles of rocketry. The goal is to optimize motor selection, body dimensions, materials, aerodynamics, parachute specifications, and launch configurations.

### Step 1: Motor Selection
Given the previous designs and outcomes, I'll continue to utilize the **CesaroniM1670** motor. This motor provides sufficient thrust (2200 N) with a total impulse of 6023.6 Ns, which efficiently balances power and safety. It is critical to ensure that the motor’s capabilities align closely with the target apogee of 3048 meters.

### Step 2: Body Dimensions and Material
- **Motor Radius**: 75 mm (0.075 m).
- **Body Radius**: I will select 0.14 m (140 mm). This radius is greater than the motor's radius, ensuring stability.
- **Body Length**: The body length will be set at 2.5 m. This dimension ensures a longer aerodynamic profile while maintaining structural integrity.

For the body material, I will use **fiberglass**. Its strength-to-weight ratio is ideal for achieving the required performance at a reasonable cost.

**Body Configuration**:
```python
"rocket_body": {
    "radius": 0.14,
    "length": 2.5,
    "material": "fiberglass",
    "thickness": 0.005,
}
```

### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
I will maintain an **ogive** shape for the nose cone:
- **Nose Cone Length**: 0.6 m, which enhances aerodynamic efficiency.
- **Material**: composite for balancing lightweight and strength.

**Nose Cone Configuration**:
```python
"nose_cone": {
    "kind": "ogive",
    "length": 0.6,
    "material": "composite",
}
```

### Step 4: Fin Design and Material
Adding stability to the ascent is crucial:
- **Number of Fins**: 4, as previously used, to enhance stability.
- **Root Chord**: 0.18 m to improve performance.
- **Tip Chord**: 0.1 m.
- **Span**: 0.35 m to provide enough surface area for stability.
- **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees.
- **Material**: carbon fiber for reduced weight and increased strength.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m.

**Fin Configuration**:
```python
"fins": {
    "number": 4,
    "root_chord": 0.18,
    "tip_chord": 0.1,
    "span": 0.35,
    "cant_angle": 0,
    "material": "carbon_fiber",
    "thickness": 0.005,
}
```

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
To ensure a safe landing speed under 5 m/s, I will specify:
- **Main Parachute Area**: 0.35 m² to slow descent adequately.
- **Drogue Parachute Area**: 0.25 m² for stabilization and decreased descent speed post-apogee.

**Parachute Configuration**:
```python
"parachutes": {
    "main": {
        "name": "Main",
        "cd_s": 0.35,
        "trigger": "apogee",
        "sampling_rate": 105,
        "lag": 1.5,
        "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
    },
    "drogue": {
        "name": "Drogue",
        "cd_s": 0.25,
        "trigger": "apogee",
        "sampling_rate": 105,
        "lag": 1.5,
        "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
    },
}
```

### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration
A stable launch configuration is necessary:
- **Rail Length**: 3.5 m for substantial guidance.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees for a vertical launch.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees for direct ascent.

**Launch Configuration**:
```python
"launch": {
    "rail_length": 3.5,
    "inclination": 90,
    "heading": 0,
}
```

### Step 7: Payload
Adding a payload:
- **Mass**: 1.0 kg for a balance of weight and performance.
- **Position**: 1.0 m, to help ensure a proper center of gravity.

**Payload Configuration**:
```python
"payload": {
    "mass": 1.0,
    "position": 1.0,
}
```

### Final Rocket Configuration
The final design configuration is as follows:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "CesaroniM1670",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.14,  # Body radius in meters

            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.25,  # Drogue parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 3.5,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 90,    # Rail inclination in degrees (vertical)
        "heading": 0,         # Launch heading in degrees (straight up)
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 1.0,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 1.0,  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    },
}
```
