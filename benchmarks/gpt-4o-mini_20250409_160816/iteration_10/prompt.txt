# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
To design a rocket that meets the target apogee of 3048 meters under the specified wind conditions and while optimizing for cost and safety, we must carefully consider motor selection, body dimensions, materials, aerodynamics, parachute specifications, and launch configuration.

### Step 1: Motor Selection

Given our target apogee, we need enough thrust to reach that altitude while ensuring the rocket can land safely. The **CesaroniM1670** has the highest total impulse of 6023.6 Ns and a max thrust of 2200 N. This provides ample power to reach the desired altitude. Although **CesaroniO5800** has a higher thrust and impulse, it is heavier and likely too powerful for our design constraint due to potentially surpassing the target apogee too drastically and leading to structural failure.

### Step 2: Body Dimensions and Material

We select a body radius greater than the motor radius for stability. 

- **Motor Radius**: CesaroniM1670 has a 75 mm radius (0.075 m). 
- **Design Body Radius**: We'll use a radius of 0.1 m (100 mm), which is greater and provides stability. 

Assuming a body length of 1.5 meters is a reasonable starting point for a rocket intended to reach 3048 meters, representing a balance between size and aerodynamics.

For the body material, **aluminum** is a lightweight and strong choice that balances safety and cost.

**Body Config:**
- Radius: 0.1 m
- Length: 1.5 m
- Material: aluminum
- Thickness: 0.005 m

### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material

An **ogive** nose cone shape is ideal for minimizing drag at subsonic speeds.

- Nose Cone Length: 0.5 m (provides good aerodynamics).
- Material: composite for its strength-to-weight ratio.

**Nose Cone Config:**
- Shape: ogive
- Length: 0.5 m
- Material: composite

### Step 4: Fin Design and Material

Stability is crucial, and using four fins enhances stability while maintaining a good flight trajectory.

- Root Chord: 0.15 m
- Tip Chord: 0.075 m
- Span: 0.3 m
- Cant Angle: 0 degrees for vertical stability.
- Material: carbon fiber, known for its lightweight and strong properties.
- Thickness: 0.005 m

**Fin Config:**
- Number of Fins: 4
- Root Chord: 0.15 m
- Tip Chord: 0.075 m
- Span: 0.3 m
- Cant Angle: 0
- Material: carbon_fiber
- Thickness: 0.005 m

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications

To ensure a safe landing under 5 m/s, we need to include parachutes.

- Main parachute area: 0.25 m² for gradual descent.
- Drogue parachute area: 0.2 m² to stabilize and slow initial descent after apogee.

**Parachute Config:**
- Main Parachute Area: 0.25 m²
- Drogue Parachute Area: 0.2 m²

### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration

- Rail Length: 2.5 meters for sufficient guide distance.
- Inclination: 90 degrees for a vertical launch.
- Heading: 0 degrees (straight up).

**Final Rocket Configuration**:

--- ATTEMPT 2 ---
Design:
Given the design requirements and previous attempts, let's refine the rocket design to improve the apogee while maintaining safety and cost-effectiveness. Here’s the reasoning behind the choices:

### Step 1: Motor Selection
For this attempt, I will select the **CesaroniO3700** motor. While this motor has a higher thrust and total impulse, it is crucial to balance this power with the correct weight and aerodynamics of the rocket to ensure we do not exceed our target apogee significantly.

### Step 2: Body Dimensions and Material
The selected motor has a radius of **161 mm**, so the rocket body must be larger for stability. 

- **Body Radius**: 0.2 m (200 mm) provides stability while being greater than the motor radius.
- **Body Length**: 2.0 m offers a balance between stability and drag.

For the body material, I will choose **fiberglass**, a good compromise between strength, weight, and cost.

**Body Config:**
- Radius: 0.2 m
- Length: 2.0 m
- Material: fiberglass
- Thickness: 0.005 m

### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
I will again opt for an **ogive** nose cone due to its drag-reducing properties.

- Nose Cone Length: 0.5 m (length aids aerodynamics).
- Material: composite for added strength.

**Nose Cone Config:**
- Shape: ogive
- Length: 0.5 m
- Material: composite

### Step 4: Fin Design and Material
Stability is key; I will keep four fins but increase the dimensions slightly for more stability.

- Root Chord: 0.2 m
- Tip Chord: 0.1 m
- Span: 0.4 m
- Cant Angle: 0 degrees.

**Fin Material**: **carbon fiber**, lightweight and strong.
- Thickness: 0.005 m.

**Fin Config:**
- Number of Fins: 4
- Root Chord: 0.2 m
- Tip Chord: 0.1 m
- Span: 0.4 m
- Cant Angle: 0
- Material: carbon fiber
- Thickness: 0.005 m

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
To target a safe landing speed under 5 m/s, I will increase the parachute area.

- Main parachute area: **0.4 m²** for a gentle descent.
- Drogue parachute area: **0.3 m²** to stabilize and slow the initial descent after apogee.

**Parachute Config:**
- Main Parachute Area: 0.4 m²
- Drogue Parachute Area: 0.3 m²

### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration
- **Rail Length**: 3.0 meters for a stable launch.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees for a vertical launch.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees (straight up, accounting for initial wind).

Design:
To design a rocket capable of reaching an apogee of 3048 meters, it's essential to carefully analyze each component while maximizing performance, maintaining structural integrity, and ensuring safety during landing. Based on the insights from the previous attempts and aiming to optimize the design further, here’s the refined rocket design:

### Step 1: Motor Selection
In this design, we'll select the **CesaroniM1670** motor. This motor's balanced thrust-to-weight ratio, which has a maximum thrust of 2200 N and a total impulse of 6023.6 Ns, is adequate to reach the target apogee without straying too far above it, minimizing the risk of structural failure. 

### Step 2: Body Dimensions and Material
For stability and to ensure a significant apogee, we'll select the following dimensions:
- **Motor Radius**: CesaroniM1670 has a radius of 75 mm (0.075 m). 
- **Rocket Body Radius**: Set at **0.12 m (120 mm)** to ensure stability, while being greater than the motor's radius.
- **Body Length**: Set at approximately **2.0 m**, providing adequate length without incurring excessive drag.

For materials, I’ll choose **fiberglass**, which is strong yet lightweight, offering a good balance of cost and structural integrity.

**Body Config:**
- Radius: 0.12 m
- Length: 2.0 m
- Material: fiberglass
- Thickness: 0.005 m 

### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
An **ogive** design for the nose cone will be used due to its excellent aerodynamic properties. 
- **Nose Cone Length**: 0.5 m.
- **Material**: composite for improved strength and reduced weight. 

**Nose Cone Config:**

Design:
To design a rocket that targets an apogee of 3048 meters, with considerations for cost, safety, structural integrity, and wind conditions, I will carefully select each component based on previous attempts and gather insights into how to improve the design's performance.

### Step 1: Motor Selection
I will select the **CesaroniM1670** motor. 
- Reasoning: It has a maximum thrust of 2200 N and a total impulse of 6023.6 Ns. This balance of thrust and impulse is suitable for achieving the designated apogee while allowing for manageable ascent and descent characteristics. 

### Step 2: Body Dimensions and Material
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius (0.075m):
- **Body Radius**: 0.13 m (130 mm) to ensure stability and adequate volume.
- **Body Length**: Set to **2.5 m**. This extra length helps improve stability and aerodynamics while allowing the rocket to carry necessary components. 
- **Material**: Use **fiberglass**, which offers sufficient strength, durability, and reasonable cost.

```python
"rocket_body": {
    "radius": 0.13,   
    "length": 2.5,   
    "material": "fiberglass",
    "thickness": 0.005,
}
```

### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
I will opt for an **ogive** shape as it provides the best aerodynamic performance:
- **Nose Cone Length**: 0.6 m (to enhance aerodynamic efficiency).
- **Material**: composite for its lightweight and strong characteristics.

```python
"nose_cone": {
    "kind": "ogive",
    "length": 0.6,
    "material": "composite",
}
```

```python
"fins": {
    "number": 4,
    "root_chord": 0.2,   
    "tip_chord": 0.1,   
    "span": 0.4,    
    "cant_angle": 0,
    "material": "carbon_fiber",
    "thickness": 0.005,
}
```

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
To ensure a landing speed below 5 m/s:
- **Main Parachute Area**: 0.35 m² for adequate slowing of descent.
- **Drogue Parachute Area**: 0.25 m² to stabilize the rocket and slow descent after reaching apogee.

```python
"parachutes": {
    "main": {
        "name": "Main",
        "cd_s": 0.35,
        "trigger": "apogee",
        "sampling_rate": 105,
        "lag": 1.5,
        "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),

        "name": "Drogue",
        "cd_s": 0.25,
        "trigger": "apogee",
        "sampling_rate": 105,
        "lag": 1.5,
        "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
    },
}
```

### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration
To provide a stable launch environment:
- **Rail Length**: 3.0 m to offer ample guidance and stability against wind conditions.

Design:
To design a rocket aimed at reaching the target apogee of 3048 meters while accounting for safety, structural integrity, costs, and wind conditions, I will streamline my design choices based on previous attempts as well as fundamental principles of rocketry. The goal is to optimize motor selection, body dimensions, materials, aerodynamics, parachute specifications, and launch configurations.

### Step 1: Motor Selection
Given the previous designs and outcomes, I'll continue to utilize the **CesaroniM1670** motor. This motor provides sufficient thrust (2200 N) with a total impulse of 6023.6 Ns, which efficiently balances power and safety. It is critical to ensure that the motor’s capabilities align closely with the target apogee of 3048 meters.

### Step 2: Body Dimensions and Material

    "tip_chord": 0.1,
    "span": 0.35,
    "cant_angle": 0,
    "material": "carbon_fiber",
    "thickness": 0.005,
}
```

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
To ensure a safe landing speed under 5 m/s, I will specify:
- **Main Parachute Area**: 0.35 m² to slow descent adequately.
- **Drogue Parachute Area**: 0.25 m² for stabilization and decreased descent speed post-apogee.

**Parachute Configuration**:
```python
"parachutes": {
    "main": {
