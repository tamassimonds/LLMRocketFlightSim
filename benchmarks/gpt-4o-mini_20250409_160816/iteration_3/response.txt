To design a rocket capable of reaching an apogee of 3048 meters, it's essential to carefully analyze each component while maximizing performance, maintaining structural integrity, and ensuring safety during landing. Based on the insights from the previous attempts and aiming to optimize the design further, here’s the refined rocket design:

### Step 1: Motor Selection
In this design, we'll select the **CesaroniM1670** motor. This motor's balanced thrust-to-weight ratio, which has a maximum thrust of 2200 N and a total impulse of 6023.6 Ns, is adequate to reach the target apogee without straying too far above it, minimizing the risk of structural failure. 

### Step 2: Body Dimensions and Material
For stability and to ensure a significant apogee, we'll select the following dimensions:
- **Motor Radius**: CesaroniM1670 has a radius of 75 mm (0.075 m). 
- **Rocket Body Radius**: Set at **0.12 m (120 mm)** to ensure stability, while being greater than the motor's radius.
- **Body Length**: Set at approximately **2.0 m**, providing adequate length without incurring excessive drag.

For materials, I’ll choose **fiberglass**, which is strong yet lightweight, offering a good balance of cost and structural integrity.

**Body Config:**
- Radius: 0.12 m
- Length: 2.0 m
- Material: fiberglass
- Thickness: 0.005 m 

### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
An **ogive** design for the nose cone will be used due to its excellent aerodynamic properties. 
- **Nose Cone Length**: 0.5 m.
- **Material**: composite for improved strength and reduced weight. 

**Nose Cone Config:**
- Kind: ogive
- Length: 0.5 m
- Material: composite 

### Step 4: Fin Design and Material
For enhanced stability during flight, a configuration of **four fins** with the following dimensions is selected:
- **Root Chord**: 0.15 m
- **Tip Chord**: 0.075 m
- **Span**: 0.3 m
- **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees for vertical stability.
- **Material**: carbon fiber is chosen for its lightweight strength.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m.

**Fin Config:**
- Number of Fins: 4
- Root Chord: 0.15 m
- Tip Chord: 0.075 m
- Span: 0.3 m
- Cant Angle: 0
- Material: carbon fiber
- Thickness: 0.005 m 

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications
To ensure a safe landing velocity under 5 m/s, I will specify:
- **Main parachute area**: 0.35 m² for a gentle descent.
- **Drogue parachute area**: 0.25 m² to stabilize and dampen descent speed after apogee.

**Parachute Config:**
- Main: 
  - Name: Main
  - cd_s: 0.35
  - Trigger: apogee
  - Sampling rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)
- Drogue: 
  - Name: Drogue
  - cd_s: 0.25
  - Trigger: apogee
  - Sampling rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration
- **Rail Length**: 3.0 meters to provide adequate guidance.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees for a straight vertical launch.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees to align with wind from the east.

### Final Rocket Configuration
Here’s the final proposed configuration for submission, addressing the previous attempts' shortcomings:
