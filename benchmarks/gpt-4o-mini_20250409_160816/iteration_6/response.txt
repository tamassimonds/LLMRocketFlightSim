To design a rocket that can efficiently reach the target apogee of 3048 meters while ensuring safety upon landing, maintaining structural integrity, and minimizing costs, let’s analyze the requirements and integrate insights from previous attempts. Here's the refined design:

### Step 1: Motor Selection

I'll stick with the **CesaroniM1670**. It provides a balanced thrust, total impulse, and is likely to avoid surpassing the target apogee significantly.

- **Maximum Thrust**: 2200 N
- **Total Impulse**: 6023.6 Ns

### Step 2: Body Dimensions and Material

- **Motor Radius**: CesaroniM1670 has a radius of 75 mm (0.075 m). 
- **Body Radius**: I recommend a radius of **0.15 m (150 mm)**. This ensures stability while being greater than the motor radius.
- **Body Length**: A length of **2.2 m** balances drag reduction and stability.

For the body material, we’ll use **fiberglass**, striking a balance between weight and structural integrity while being cost-effective.

**Body Configuration**:
- Radius: 0.15 m
- Length: 2.2 m
- Material: fiberglass
- Thickness: 0.005 m

### Step 3: Nose Cone Dimensions and Material

An **ogive** design remains the best choice for minimizing aerodynamic drag:

- **Nose Cone Length**: 0.5 m.
- **Material**: composite for strength and lightweight properties.

**Nose Cone Configuration**:
- Kind: ogive
- Length: 0.5 m
- Material: composite 

### Step 4: Fin Design and Material

For stability, I'll select:
- **Number of Fins**: 4.
- **Root Chord**: 0.2 m for improved lift and stability.
- **Tip Chord**: 0.1 m.
- **Span**: 0.35 m to enhance surface area.
- **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees for vertical stability.
- **Material**: carbon fiber for lightweight strength.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m.

**Fin Configuration**:
- Number of Fins: 4
- Root Chord: 0.2 m
- Tip Chord: 0.1 m
- Span: 0.35 m
- Cant Angle: 0
- Material: carbon fiber
- Thickness: 0.005 m 

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications

To ensure a landing speed under 5 m/s:
- **Main Parachute Area**: **0.4 m²** for gradual descent.
- **Drogue Parachute Area**: **0.2 m²** to stabilize and slow the descent after apogee.

**Parachute Configuration**:
- Main:
  - Name: Main
  - cd_s: 0.4
  - Trigger: apogee
  - Sampling rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

- Drogue:
  - Name: Drogue
  - cd_s: 0.2
  - Trigger: apogee
  - Sampling rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration

To provide adequate stability against wind:
- **Rail Length**: **3.5 meters** for better guidance.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees for a vertical launch.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees for a straight-up launch.

### Final Rocket Configuration
