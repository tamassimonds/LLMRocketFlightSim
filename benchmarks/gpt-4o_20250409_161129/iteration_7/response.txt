To improve upon previous attempts and reach the target apogee of 3,048 meters effectively while maintaining cost efficiency, structural integrity, and a safe landing, we need to closely examine the interplay between motor choice, rocket dimensions, materials, and aerodynamics. Here's a revised strategy to achieve the optimal configuration:

### Key Considerations:

1. **Motor Selection**: The motor should provide sufficient impulse to reach the target apogee while being cost-effective. Previous errors occurred due to either insufficient thrust or misalignment with the rocket's mass and aerodynamic profile.

2. **Weight and Aerodynamic Management**: A balance of weight and drag management is critical to achieving the desired altitude without incurring excessive costs.

3. **Material Selection**: Implement materials that offer a high strength-to-weight ratio to ensure the rocket maintains structural integrity under varying aerodynamic stresses.

4. **Fin Configuration**: Optimize fin dimensions for stability during flight and managing angular velocities.

### Design Strategy:

#### Motor Choice:
- **Motor**: Opt for the **CesaroniM1670**. With a total impulse of 6023.6 Ns, it is powerful enough for reaching significant altitudes and provides a higher thrust ceiling compared to smaller motors, with a moderate cost. This more powerful motor should be used in conjunction with a larger and sturdier rocket body.

#### Rocket Body:
- **Radius**: 0.16 m to accommodate the larger motor and enhance stability.
- **Length**: 2.2 m to provide adequate internal volume for components and minimize aerodynamic drag.
- **Material**: **composite** for superior strength and lightweight characteristics.
- **Thickness**: 0.01 m to ensure durability while keeping the weight low.

#### Aerodynamics:
- **Nose Cone**:
  - **Kind**: **von karman** is optimal for minimizing drag at higher speeds.
  - **Length**: 0.55 m to elongate the aerodynamic profile and enhance performance.
  - **Material**: **composite** for improved efficiency at high speeds.
- **Fins**:
  - **Number**: 4 to provide enhanced stability at high speeds.
  - **Root Chord**: 0.3 m
  - **Tip Chord**: 0.15 m
  - **Span**: 0.25 m
  - **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees to maintain direction stability.
  - **Material**: **carbon_fiber** for reduced weight and increased strength.
  - **Thickness**: 0.005 m
- **Tail**:
  - **Length**: 0.25 m
  - **Top Radius**: 0.1 m
  - **Bottom Radius**: 0.15 m
  - **Material**: **composite**

#### Parachutes:
- **Main**:
  - **cd_s**: 1.0 for effective deceleration and safe landing speed.
- **Drogue**:
  - **cd_s**: 0.4 for initial stabilization during descent.

#### Launch Rail:
- **Rail Length**: 6.0 m for extended guidance and stability during initial ascent.
- **Inclination**: 85 degrees to compensate for wind conditions, allowing vertical thrust to counteract drift.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees to minimize lateral drift.

#### Payload:
- **Mass**: 0.6 kg for balance and stability control during ascent.
- **Position**: 1.1 m to optimize stability and center of gravity.
