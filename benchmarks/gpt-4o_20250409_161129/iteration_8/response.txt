## Improved Rocket Design Strategy

From previous attempts, it's clear that striking a balance between thrust, weight, and aerodynamic efficiency is critical to achieving the target apogee of 3,048 meters without overshooting or undershooting. Hereâ€™s how we can refine our approach:

### Key Insights from Previous Attempts:

1. **Motor Selection**: A motor with adequate thrust and impulse that fits the rocket's overall mass and drag characteristics is crucial. Previous motors either overshot or fell short of the requirements due to a mismatch in these parameters.

2. **Material Optimization**: Using lightweight, strong materials ensures structural integrity without unnecessary mass. Composite materials have been effective but come with a higher cost.

3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Nose cone shape and fin design significantly affect aerodynamic drag and stability. The von Karman nose cone has shown better drag reduction compared to simpler shapes.

4. **Weight Distribution and Stability**: Fin arrangement and payload positioning play a significant role in maintaining stability and controlling the rocket's trajectory.

### Revised Design Strategy:

#### Motor Choice:
- **Motor**: Return to **Pro75M1670** due to its balanced impulse and thrust for our desired apogee and cost considerations. Previous attempts with much stronger motors often overshot or failed due to mismatching weight distribution.

#### Rocket Body:
- **Radius**: 0.085 m, sufficient for the motor while streamlined for reduced drag.
- **Length**: 1.8 m, balancing aerodynamic efficiency and stability.
- **Material**: **fiberglass**, which affords a good balance between cost and strength.
- **Thickness**: 0.01 m for structural integrity without excess weight.

#### Aerodynamics:
- **Nose Cone**:
  - **Kind**: **von karman** for optimal drag reduction at the expected speed.
  - **Length**: 0.45 m, optimizing the aerodynamic profile.
  - **Material**: **fiberglass** aligns with the rest of the body.
- **Fins**:
  - **Number**: 4 fins for optimized stability without unnecessary weight.
  - **Root Chord**: 0.15 m
  - **Tip Chord**: 0.075 m
  - **Span**: 0.25 m, improving maneuverability.
  - **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees for stability without spin.
  - **Material**: **carbon_fiber** for reducing weight while maintaining strength.
  - **Thickness**: 0.004 m
- **Tail**:
  - **Length**: 0.15 m
  - **Top Radius**: 0.075 m
  - **Bottom Radius**: 0.085 m, ensuring stability.
  - **Material**: **fiberglass** for consistency.

#### Parachutes:
- **Main**:
  - **cd_s**: 0.9 for safe landing speeds.
- **Drogue**:
  - **cd_s**: 0.3 for initial descent stability.

#### Launch Rail:
- **Rail Length**: 5.0 m for adequate initial stability during takeoff.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees for maximum altitude.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees, minimizing drift and optimizing vertical ascent.

#### Payload:
- **Mass**: 0.35 kg, balancing the rocket for the chosen thrust profile.
- **Position**: 0.9 m for optimized center of gravity and flight stability.
