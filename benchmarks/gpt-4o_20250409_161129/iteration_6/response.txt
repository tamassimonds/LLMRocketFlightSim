To improve upon previous attempts and reach the target apogee of 3,048 meters effectively while maintaining cost efficiency, structural integrity, and a safe landing, we'll need to re-evaluate the rocket design components and their interplay. Here are the key focus areas for improvements:

### Key Considerations:

1. **Motor Selection**: Selecting a motor that can deliver the appropriate impulse and thrust within budget is critical. Many high-thrust motors are costly and excessive for the needed altitude, while insufficient motors lead to undershooting.

2. **Weight and Aerodynamic Management**: A balance of weight and drag management is key to achieving the right apogee without incurring excessive costs.

3. **Material Selection**: Implement stronger, lighter materials where necessary to ensure the rocket maintains structural integrity under varying aerodynamic stresses.

4. **Optimize Fin Configuration**: Fins remain a critical element for stability during flight and managing angular velocities.

### Suggested Design Strategy:

#### Motor Choice:
- **Motor**: Opt for the **CesaroniM1670**. With 6023.6 Ns total impulse, it is powerful and should be suitable for significant altitude goals. This provides a higher thrust ceiling compared to smaller motors, with a moderate cost.

#### Rocket Body:
- **Radius**: 0.082 m to fit the chosen motor comfortably while retaining a streamlined profile.
- **Length**: 1.5 m to ensure stability and provide sufficient space for internal components.
- **Material**: **fiberglass** for its balance of strength and weight.
- **Thickness**: 0.008 m to minimize weight while maintaining structure.

#### Aerodynamics:
- **Nose Cone**:
  - **Kind**: **von karman** for its minimal drag properties at higher speeds.
  - **Length**: 0.5 m to elongate the aerodynamic profile and reduce drag.
  - **Material**: **composite** for improved performance in high-speed and elevated thrust conditions.
- **Fins**:
  - **Number**: 4 for enhanced stability control at high speeds.
  - **Root Chord**: 0.2 m
  - **Tip Chord**: 0.1 m
  - **Span**: 0.3 m, offering control over pitch and roll while minimizing drag.
  - **Cant Angle**: 1 degree to induce minimal spin for stabilization.
  - **Material**: **carbon_fiber** for reduced weight and high strength.
  - **Thickness**: 0.004 m
- **Tail**:
  - **Length**: 0.2 m
  - **Top Radius**: 0.07 m
  - **Bottom Radius**: 0.08 m
  - **Material**: **composite**

#### Parachutes:
- **Main**:
  - **cd_s**: 0.85 to ensure a safe velocity descent within the safe threshold.
- **Drogue**:
  - **cd_s**: 0.3 for preliminary slowing.

#### Launch Rail:
- **Rail Length**: 5.5 m for extended launch guidance to stabilize initial flight.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees to maximize vertical thrust efficiency.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees to minimize any lateral drift for a directed ascent.

#### Payload:
- **Mass**: 0.5 kg for center stability during flight.
- **Position**: 0.95 m, optimizing payload distribution for flight stability.
