To improve upon the previous attempts and better meet the target apogee while managing structural integrity, costs, and safe landing conditions, we need to analyze the key areas of improvement:

### Key Improvements Needed:

1. **Motor Selection**: The previous motors were either too weak or too strong relative to the rocket's mass and design. The **CesaroniO3700** was too powerful, leading to very high costs and possibly inefficiency due to overpowered elements. Let's opt for a more balanced motor that still provides enough thrust: **AeroTechK700W**. It offers a total impulse of 2249 Ns, which is balanced for the desired apogee without excessive costs.

2. **Rocket Dimensions and Material**:
   - **Body Radius**: Ensure it fits the motor. The **AeroTechK700W** has a 54 mm radius, so we can afford a 0.08 m body radius for added stability while keeping it less bulky.
   - **Material**: Use fiberglass to balance cost and strength.
   - **Thickness**: Maintain structural integrity with a 0.01 m thickness.

3. **Nose Cone and Fin Design**:
   - A longer nose cone and adjusted fin dimensions for better aerodynamics and stability during flight. Let's choose an ogive with slightly longer dimensions.
   - Use lightweight, strong materials such as carbon fiber for fins to reduce inertia and improve stabilization.

4. **Parachute and Descent Safety**:
   - Adjust the parachute areas for a softer landing to remain under 5 m/s. A main chute cd_s of 0.6 and a drogue of 0.3 for initial slowing.

5. **Launch Rail and Payload Configuration**:
   - A standard vertical launch with a slightly shorter rail to ensure efficiency with the chosen motor's thrust dynamics.

### Revised Rocket Design:

            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.6,  # Adequate to slow efficiently within landing speed constraints
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",

            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 4.5,  # Slightly reduced for more efficient thrust utilization
        "inclination": 90,   # Direct vertical launch for minimized horizontal drift
        "heading": 0,        # Straight vertical for efficiency and stability
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # Slightly reduced to manage apogee and performance demands
        "position": 0.9,  # Centred more towards the mass distribution
    }
}
```

### Expected Outcome:

- **Apogee Improvement**: The **AeroTechK700W** should help in optimizing the altitude with a good balance of impulse and thrust for the rocket mass and design.
- **Structural and Stability Improvements**: Adjustments to dimensions and materials should aid in maintaining balance and integrity throughout flight phases.
- **Cost Efficiency**: This configuration aims to remain under budget constraints while optimizing apogee and safety aspects.

This refined approach should align with the objective of achieving a closer match to the apogee target, enabling safe landings and structural integrity.
