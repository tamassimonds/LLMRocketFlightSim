# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
To tackle this rocket design task, we'll start by breaking down each of the components and their trade-offs. Our goal is to design a rocket that will reach an apogee of 3,048 meters with minimal horizontal drift, within budget constraints, and with a safe landing speed. Additionally, we want to avoid structural failures.

### 1. Motor Selection
The motor is perhaps the most significant choice in terms of impacting performance since it directly relates to thrust and impulse, which defines the potential altitude the rocket can achieve.

Available motors:

1. **Pro75M1670**
2. **AeroTechK700W**
3. **CesaroniM1670**
4. **AeroTechH128W**
5. **CesaroniO3700**
6. **CesaroniO5800**
7. **CesaroniK160**

In order to reach approximately 3 km in height, it is essential to choose a motor with a decent total impulse but not excessively powerful (which would overshoot the target) and too expensive. We also want to consider cost and the physical size of the motor in relation to the rocket body.

- **Pro75M1670 and CesaroniM1670** have the same specifications, and both are strong choices due to their total impulse at safe, manageable thrusts. However, they might be overkill unless we carefully match the mass with the reduced thrust.
- **AeroTechK700W** provides less impulse compared to the other two, but owing to its cost efficiency and reduced mass, it might suit our needs for economy.
- Given the mass and thrust comparisons, I aim for a balance, and thus **Pro75M1670** due to its moderate impulse will suffice.

### 2. Rocket Body Design

- **Radius**: The motor radius at 75 mm (0.075 m) necessitates a slightly larger rocket body, for instance, 0.1 m to ensure fitting and structural resource for other components and stability.
- **Length**: We estimate the length by a thumb rule of 10-15 times the radius of the body, aimed for a good aerodynamic profile and stability. Thus, setting a length of about 1.5 m works nicely.
- **Material Choice**: For a balance of cost and strength, fiberglass is chosen, providing a decent strength-to-weight ratio.
- **Thickness**: 0.01 m gives structural integrity without unnecessary mass while maintaining economics.

### 3. Nose Cone Design
Nose cone designs significantly impact aerodynamic efficiency:

- **Type**: An ogive nose cone is common and efficient for subsonic and low supersonic speeds.
- **Length**: We choose 0.3 m, aligning with known efficient scales and providing a balance.
- **Material**: Similar to the body, to ensure structural match, fiberglass is chosen.

### 4. Fin Design
Aerodynamic stability and yaw control:

- **Number**: 4 fins provide a necessary stability margin; this is typical for hobby rockets.
- **Root and Tip Chords**: Root chord of 0.15 m and tip chord 0.075 m gives suitable taper for stability.
- **Span & Cant Angle**: A span of 0.2 m and cant angle of 1 degree introduce slight spin stability.
- **Thickness & Material**: A thickness of 0.005 m in carbon fiber for lightweight and stronger load distribution.

### 5. Tail Design
Contributes to stability at the launch phase:

- **Length**: 0.2 m
- **Top & Bottom Radius**: Ensuring different radii of 0.1 m and 0.12 m for aerodynamic flow.
- **Material**: Very lightweight and cheap ABS plastic.

### 6. Parachutes
- **Main and Drogue choice**: Ensure decent drag and control on descent.
- **cd_s values**: Set to ensure sufficiently gentle landing.
- No changes in trigger methodology (use defaults).

### 7. Launch Rail Configuration
To adjust to wind and facilitate efflux:
- **Length**: 5 meters for stability in descent.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees accounting for the east wind of 5 m/s, to reduce horizontal drift during the launch phase.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees vertical for minimal initial drift.

### 8. Payload
- **Mass & Position**: 0.5 kg centered, aligning with the center of mass shifting minimally.

Now, we'll encapsulate these details into a configuration dictionary for our simulation:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "Pro75M1670",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.1,

            "bottom_radius": 0.12,
            "material": "ABS_plastic",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.3,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.2,
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 5.0,
        "inclination": 90,
        "heading": 0,
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.5,
        "position": 0.75,
    }
}
```

This configuration evaluates constraints while optimizing for cost and performance. The decisions reflect an appreciation for aerodynamic performance and efficient cost, meeting our safety and performance requirements effectively.

Design:
To improve upon the previous design and achieve a higher apogee closer to the target of 3,048 meters, it is important to make some adjustments, particularly in the motor choice and potentially the aerodynamic design. Let’s carefully consider each component again:

### Key Improvements Needed:

1. **Motor Selection**: The previous design's motor, **Pro75M1670**, did not provide enough thrust to achieve the target apogee. I will use a more powerful motor that fits within the rocket body: **CesaroniO3700**. This motor has a significantly higher total impulse and average thrust, which can better meet the altitude requirement.

2. **Body Radius**: The motor radius for **CesaroniO3700** is 161 mm (0.161 m). Therefore, the body radius should be slightly larger, let's choose 0.18 m, which will help accommodate the motor and provide structural integrity.

3. **Stability and Fin Design**: Larger fins might help with stability due to the high thrust of the selected motor. 

4. **Material Adjustment**: Given the increase in weight and thrust, consider using composite material for enhanced strength and reduced weight.

### Revised Rocket Design:

Using the insights above, here’s a revised configuration:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "CesaroniO3700",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.18,  # Increased to fit the larger motor
        "length": 2.5,   # Larger body to accommodate motor and payload
        "material": "composite",  # Stronger material for higher thrust and weight
        "thickness": 0.01,
    },
    "aerodynamics": {
        "nose_cone": {
            "kind": "ogive",  # Efficient at reducing drag for sub-to-supersonic transition
            "length": 0.5,    # Increased length for better aerodynamics
            "material": "composite",  # To match the body material
        },
        "fins": {
            "number": 4,
            "root_chord": 0.3,   # Larger for better stability
            "tip_chord": 0.15,   # Adjusted for efficient taper
            "span": 0.4,         # Increased span for stability
            "cant_angle": 1,     # Small angle for minimal induced rotation
            "material": "carbon_fiber",  # Strong, lightweight material
            "thickness": 0.005,
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.2,  
            "top_radius": 0.15,  # Adjusted larger top radius
            "bottom_radius": 0.18,  # Wider for stable rocket trail adjustment
            "material": "composite",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 1.0,  # Larger surface area for stability during descent
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.5,  # Increased drogue size for initial deceleration
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 5.5,  # Longer rail for enhanced initial stability and guidance
        "inclination": 85,   # Slightly angled to counteract the wind and account for optimal path
        "heading": 90,       # Launch towards the east to reduce drift
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.8,  # Increased mass for stability with larger motor power
        "position": 1.25,  # Centers the mass position based on new body length
    }
}
```

### Expected Outcome:

- **Improved Apogee**: With the **CesaroniO3700** motor, the rocket should achieve a much higher apogee closer to the target.
- **Stability**: Larger fins and a slightly angled launch should manage drift and ensure structural integrity.
- **Safety**: Increased parachute sizes and proper rail length and inclination maintain landing safety and horizontal distance management.

### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the cost remains within the target budget, though some increase might be justified if it ensures meeting the apogee goal.
- Reassess after simulation to see if further fin or parachute adjustments are necessary based on behavior (oscillation, stability).

This redesign should offer a better chance of reaching the target specification while maintaining safety and performance efficiency.

Design:
To improve upon the previous attempts and better meet the target apogee while managing structural integrity, costs, and safe landing conditions, we need to analyze the key areas of improvement:

### Key Improvements Needed:

1. **Motor Selection**: The previous motors were either too weak or too strong relative to the rocket's mass and design. The **CesaroniO3700** was too powerful, leading to very high costs and possibly inefficiency due to overpowered elements. Let's opt for a more balanced motor that still provides enough thrust: **AeroTechK700W**. It offers a total impulse of 2249 Ns, which is balanced for the desired apogee without excessive costs.

2. **Rocket Dimensions and Material**:
   - **Body Radius**: Ensure it fits the motor. The **AeroTechK700W** has a 54 mm radius, so we can afford a 0.08 m body radius for added stability while keeping it less bulky.
   - **Material**: Use fiberglass to balance cost and strength.
   - **Thickness**: Maintain structural integrity with a 0.01 m thickness.

3. **Nose Cone and Fin Design**:
   - A longer nose cone and adjusted fin dimensions for better aerodynamics and stability during flight. Let's choose an ogive with slightly longer dimensions.
   - Use lightweight, strong materials such as carbon fiber for fins to reduce inertia and improve stabilization.

4. **Parachute and Descent Safety**:
   - Adjust the parachute areas for a softer landing to remain under 5 m/s. A main chute cd_s of 0.6 and a drogue of 0.3 for initial slowing.

5. **Launch Rail and Payload Configuration**:
   - A standard vertical launch with a slightly shorter rail to ensure efficiency with the chosen motor's thrust dynamics.

## Improved Rocket Design Strategy

From previous attempts, it's clear that striking a balance between thrust, weight, and aerodynamic efficiency is critical to achieving the target apogee of 3,048 meters without overshooting or undershooting. Here’s how we can refine our approach:

### Key Insights from Previous Attempts:

1. **Motor Selection**: A motor with adequate thrust and impulse that fits the rocket's overall mass and drag characteristics is crucial. Previous motors either overshot or fell short of the requirements due to a mismatch in these parameters.

2. **Material Optimization**: Using lightweight, strong materials ensures structural integrity without unnecessary mass. Composite materials have been effective but come with a higher cost.

3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Nose cone shape and fin design significantly affect aerodynamic drag and stability. The von Karman nose cone has shown better drag reduction compared to simpler shapes.

4. **Weight Distribution and Stability**: Fin arrangement and payload positioning play a significant role in maintaining stability and controlling the rocket's trajectory.

### Revised Design Strategy:

#### Motor Choice:
- **Motor**: Return to **Pro75M1670** due to its balanced impulse and thrust for our desired apogee and cost considerations. Previous attempts with much stronger motors often overshot or failed due to mismatching weight distribution.

#### Rocket Body:
- **Radius**: 0.085 m, sufficient for the motor while streamlined for reduced drag.
- **Length**: 1.8 m, balancing aerodynamic efficiency and stability.
- **Material**: **fiberglass**, which affords a good balance between cost and strength.
- **Thickness**: 0.01 m for structural integrity without excess weight.

#### Aerodynamics:
- **Nose Cone**:
  - **Kind**: **von karman** for optimal drag reduction at the expected speed.
  - **Length**: 0.45 m, optimizing the aerodynamic profile.
  - **Material**: **fiberglass** aligns with the rest of the body.
- **Fins**:
  - **Number**: 4 fins for optimized stability without unnecessary weight.
  - **Root Chord**: 0.15 m
  - **Tip Chord**: 0.075 m
  - **Span**: 0.25 m, improving maneuverability.
  - **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees for stability without spin.
  - **Material**: **carbon_fiber** for reducing weight while maintaining strength.
  - **Thickness**: 0.004 m
- **Tail**:
  - **Length**: 0.15 m
  - **Top Radius**: 0.075 m
  - **Bottom Radius**: 0.085 m, ensuring stability.
  - **Material**: **fiberglass** for consistency.

#### Parachutes:
- **Main**:
  - **cd_s**: 0.9 for safe landing speeds.
- **Drogue**:
  - **cd_s**: 0.3 for initial descent stability.

#### Launch Rail:
- **Rail Length**: 5.0 m for adequate initial stability during takeoff.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees for maximum altitude.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees, minimizing drift and optimizing vertical ascent.

#### Payload:
- **Mass**: 0.35 kg, balancing the rocket for the chosen thrust profile.
- **Position**: 0.9 m for optimized center of gravity and flight stability.
