To tackle this rocket design task, we'll start by breaking down each of the components and their trade-offs. Our goal is to design a rocket that will reach an apogee of 3,048 meters with minimal horizontal drift, within budget constraints, and with a safe landing speed. Additionally, we want to avoid structural failures.

### 1. Motor Selection
The motor is perhaps the most significant choice in terms of impacting performance since it directly relates to thrust and impulse, which defines the potential altitude the rocket can achieve.

Available motors:

1. **Pro75M1670**
2. **AeroTechK700W**
3. **CesaroniM1670**
4. **AeroTechH128W**
5. **CesaroniO3700**
6. **CesaroniO5800**
7. **CesaroniK160**

In order to reach approximately 3 km in height, it is essential to choose a motor with a decent total impulse but not excessively powerful (which would overshoot the target) and too expensive. We also want to consider cost and the physical size of the motor in relation to the rocket body.

- **Pro75M1670 and CesaroniM1670** have the same specifications, and both are strong choices due to their total impulse at safe, manageable thrusts. However, they might be overkill unless we carefully match the mass with the reduced thrust.
- **AeroTechK700W** provides less impulse compared to the other two, but owing to its cost efficiency and reduced mass, it might suit our needs for economy.
- Given the mass and thrust comparisons, I aim for a balance, and thus **Pro75M1670** due to its moderate impulse will suffice.

### 2. Rocket Body Design

- **Radius**: The motor radius at 75 mm (0.075 m) necessitates a slightly larger rocket body, for instance, 0.1 m to ensure fitting and structural resource for other components and stability.
- **Length**: We estimate the length by a thumb rule of 10-15 times the radius of the body, aimed for a good aerodynamic profile and stability. Thus, setting a length of about 1.5 m works nicely.
- **Material Choice**: For a balance of cost and strength, fiberglass is chosen, providing a decent strength-to-weight ratio.
- **Thickness**: 0.01 m gives structural integrity without unnecessary mass while maintaining economics.

### 3. Nose Cone Design
Nose cone designs significantly impact aerodynamic efficiency:

- **Type**: An ogive nose cone is common and efficient for subsonic and low supersonic speeds.
- **Length**: We choose 0.3 m, aligning with known efficient scales and providing a balance.
- **Material**: Similar to the body, to ensure structural match, fiberglass is chosen.

### 4. Fin Design
Aerodynamic stability and yaw control:

- **Number**: 4 fins provide a necessary stability margin; this is typical for hobby rockets.
- **Root and Tip Chords**: Root chord of 0.15 m and tip chord 0.075 m gives suitable taper for stability.
- **Span & Cant Angle**: A span of 0.2 m and cant angle of 1 degree introduce slight spin stability.
- **Thickness & Material**: A thickness of 0.005 m in carbon fiber for lightweight and stronger load distribution.

### 5. Tail Design
Contributes to stability at the launch phase:

- **Length**: 0.2 m
- **Top & Bottom Radius**: Ensuring different radii of 0.1 m and 0.12 m for aerodynamic flow.
- **Material**: Very lightweight and cheap ABS plastic.

### 6. Parachutes
- **Main and Drogue choice**: Ensure decent drag and control on descent.
- **cd_s values**: Set to ensure sufficiently gentle landing.
- No changes in trigger methodology (use defaults).

### 7. Launch Rail Configuration
To adjust to wind and facilitate efflux:
- **Length**: 5 meters for stability in descent.
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees accounting for the east wind of 5 m/s, to reduce horizontal drift during the launch phase.
- **Heading**: 0 degrees vertical for minimal initial drift.

### 8. Payload
- **Mass & Position**: 0.5 kg centered, aligning with the center of mass shifting minimally.

Now, we'll encapsulate these details into a configuration dictionary for our simulation:
