To design a rocket that meets the target apogee of 3,048 meters while being cost-effective, structurally sound, and ensuring a safe landing, it is crucial to find the right balance between motor choice, weight, dimensions, and drag management. Considering the insights from previous attempts, we will strategically adjust various parameters for a refined design.

### Key Considerations and Strategy

1. **Motor Selection**: Previous attempts have shown that the **Pro75M1670** has sufficient impulse but requires optimized mass and aerodynamic characteristics to reach the desired apogee. We will build the rocket around this motor again, while improving its aerodynamics and balancing the weight.

2. **Weight and Material Optimization**: We will use composite materials for critical components to reduce weight without sacrificing structural strength. This is necessary to achieve the desired thrust-to-weight ratio.

3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: We will further refine the nose cone shape and fin dimensions to minimize drag. A von Karman nose cone will be used for its effectiveness in reducing drag at higher velocities.

4. **Fin Configuration**: We will retain four fins for stability but adjust their size and material to optimize efficiency and weight.

5. **Parachute and Descent Strategy**: Ensure the parachute system allows for a safe descent speed, balancing deploy size and timing.
