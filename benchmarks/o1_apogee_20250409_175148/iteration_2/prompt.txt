# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 20 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

Before answering you should provide your full reasoning for the design choices you made thinking like a rocket scientist. Run sample calulations, make approximations etc to find best design



=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
Below is a step-by-step rationale for the proposed design, followed by the final configuration dictionary.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Motor Selection
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Target apogee is about 3048 m.  
• Smaller motors (e.g., H128 or K160) likely will not easily reach 3 km if the rocket is of moderate size.  
• The Pro75M1670 (CTI) motor provides 6023.6 Ns of total impulse and a relatively light dry mass (1.815 kg), making it suitable to loft a ~10 kg rocket near 3048 m.  
• Chose Pro75M1670 over the near-identical CesaroniM1670 because it is lighter (and potentially cheaper overall).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Body Dimensions and Material
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Motor radius is 0.075 m; rocket’s body radius must exceed that. A radius of 0.08 m is chosen to allow space around the motor and simplify construction.  
• Body length of 1.5 m is enough to house the motor (0.757 m) plus space for parachute, payload, etc., without being excessively large (helps minimize cost, drag, and mass).  
• Wall thickness of 3 mm (0.003 m) in fiberglass balances strength and weight. Fiberglass is cheaper than carbon fiber but still strong enough for ~2200 N of thrust.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Nose cone length of 0.25 m (ogive shape) provides a reasonably aerodynamic shape.  
• Material is also fiberglass for manufacturing simplicity and cost-effectiveness.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Fin Design and Material
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Three fins (instead of four) to reduce cost and drag.  
• Root chord 0.2 m, tip chord 0.08 m, span 0.15 m, thickness 0.003 m.  
• Plywood is chosen for fin material: cheaper and still robust enough for flight loads.  
• Cant angle of 0° to keep design simpler and cost lower.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Tail Specifications
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Tail length 0.15 m with top radius 0.08 m and bottom radius 0.09 m (cannot be the same, per the checks).  
• Material is fiberglass for ease of integration.  
• Slight flare (bottom radius > top radius) can help with base drag reduction.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Parachute Specifications
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• To ensure safe landing (<5 m/s) for a ~10 kg rocket, the main parachute’s Cd·S is sized at about 6.0 m². This should yield a landing velocity around or below 5 m/s (depending on exact rocket mass and conditions).  
• A drogue chute with Cd·S of 0.3 m² is included to stabilize descent before main deployment.  
• Both triggered at apogee for simplicity in this scenario (though in real flights, a drogue is often at apogee, main at lower altitude).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Launch Rail Configuration
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Rail length of 2.0 m is sufficient for stable departure.  
• Inclination of 85° from horizontal (i.e., nearly vertical) plus heading of 90° (toward the east).  
• Because the wind is 20 m/s from the east, angling very slightly eastward can help mitigate drift.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8. Payload
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• A 0.5 kg payload at 0.6 m from the rocket center keeps CG comfortably forward.
