To create an improved rocket design that effectively meets the target apogee of 3048.0 meters while ensuring a safe landing (less than 5 m/s) and minimizing costs, let's analyze the previous attempts and make some strategic adjustments.

### Analysis of Key Factors

1. **Motor Selection**: The motor must have sufficient thrust and impulse while allowing a controlled ascent to avoid overshooting the target. Previous attempts with the **CesaroniO5800** motor had high thrust but may have led to overshooting.

2. **Rocket Body**: Light weight yet capable of withstanding aerodynamic forces is crucial. The previous attempts used materials like fiberglass and composite. We need to balance strength with weight.

3. **Nose Cone**: An efficient shape (like ogive) reduces drag.

4. **Fin Design**: Provides stability while keeping weight minimal. Previous designs often opted for 4 fins, which seems adequate.

5. **Parachute Specifications**: Must ensure landing under 5 m/s.

6. **Launch Configuration**: Straight vertical launch is preferred for reaching maximum altitude.

### Optimized Design

Taking into account the previous analyses and recognizing the performance trends, here’s the proposed design:

1. **Motor Selection**: 
   - **Motor**: **Pro75M1670**
   - **Thrust**: 2200 N
   - **Total Impulse**: 6023.6 Ns
   - **Burn Time**: 3.9 s
   - **Rationale**: This motor provides a good balance between thrust and control, avoiding the overshooting issue.

2. **Rocket Body**:
   - **Radius**: 0.1 m (100 mm) to accommodate the motor's 75 mm radius.
   - **Length**: 1.5 m for stability.
   - **Material**: **Fiberglass** to ensure strength-to-weight balance.
   - **Thickness**: 0.005 m for structural integrity.

3. **Nose Cone**:
   - **Shape**: **Ogive** for reduced drag.
   - **Length**: 0.4 m for optimal aerodynamic performance.
   - **Material**: **Fiberglass** to maintain consistency.

4. **Fin Design**:
   - **Number of Fins**: 4 fins for stability.
   - **Dimensions**:
     - Root Chord: 0.12 m
     - Tip Chord: 0.06 m
     - Span: 0.3 m
   - **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees for straightforward vertical alignment.
   - **Material**: **Carbon fiber** for low weight.

5. **Parachute Specifications**:
   - **Main Parachute**: Diameter of **2.0 m**.
     - \(cd_s\) area = \( \pi \cdot (1.0^2) \approx 3.14 \, m^2\).
   - **Drogue Parachute**: Diameter of **0.5 m**.
     - \(cd_s\) area = \( \pi \cdot (0.25^2) \approx 0.196 \, m^2\).
   - **Deployment Trigger**: Both parachutes deploy at apogee.

6. **Launch Configuration**:
   - **Rail Length**: 3.0 m for stability.
   - **Inclination**: 90 degrees (vertical).
   - **Heading**: 0 degrees (launching straight up).

7. **Payload**:
   - **Mass**: 0.5 kg located at 0.75 m to help with stability.

### Summary
This design aims to balance thrust and control by using a motor that avoids excessive overshooting of the target apogee. The materials selected (fiberglass for the body and nose cone, carbon fiber for fins) provide an adequate strength-to-weight ratio. The parachute specifications ensure a safe landing. This design should achieve the desired performance while adhering to all the requirements effectively.
