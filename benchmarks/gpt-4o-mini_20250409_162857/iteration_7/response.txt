To address the task of designing a rocket that effectively reaches the target apogee of 3048.0 meters while ensuring a safe landing, minimizing costs, and adhering to structural integrity, we will carefully evaluate each design component based on previous attempts and understanding the physics behind rocket flight. 

### Design Strategy

1. **Motor Selection**: We need to select a motor that can provide sufficient thrust and total impulse, enabling a controlled ascent to the desired altitude.
  
2. **Rocket Body**: It should be lightweight but strong enough to withstand the pressures during flight and ensure stability.

3. **Nose Cone**: A well-designed nose cone will contribute to reduced aerodynamic drag.

4. **Fins**: Proper fin design is critical for stabilizing the rocket during flight.

5. **Parachute Specifications**: They must ensure a safe descent at a velocity under 5 m/s.

6. **Launch Configuration**: Needs to support a stable launch trajectory for optimal altitude gain.

### Design Components

1. **Motor Selection**:
   - Chosen Motor: **CesaroniM1670**
     - **Parameters**:
       - Thrust: 2200 N 
       - Total Impulse: 6023.6 Ns 
       - Burn Time: 3.6 s 
       - Isp: 198 s
     - **Reasoning**: This motor delivers a balance of thrust and impulse ideally suited to reach near the target apogee without excessive overshooting.

2. **Rocket Body**:
   - **Radius**: 0.12 m; satisfies the requirement of being greater than the motor's 0.075 m radius.
   - **Length**: 1.5 m for stability and structural integrity.
   - **Material**: **Fiberglass**, providing a good balance of strength and low weight.
   - **Thickness**: 0.005 m to maintain structural integrity.

3. **Nose Cone Design**:
   - **Shape**: **Ogive** for maximizing aerodynamic efficiency.
   - **Length**: 0.4 m balances between structural utility and aerodynamic performance.
   - **Material**: **Fiberglass** for consistency with the body material.

4. **Fin Design**:
   - **Number of Fins**: 4 fins for optimal stability.
   - **Dimensions**:
     - Root Chord: 0.12 m
     - Tip Chord: 0.06 m
     - Span: 0.25 m
   - **Cant Angle**: Set at 0 degrees for a vertical alignment.
   - **Material**: **Carbon fiber** for its strength-to-weight ratio.

5. **Parachute Specifications**:
   - **Main Parachute**: Diameter of 2.0 m, designed to slow down descent effectively. 
     - \( cd_s = \pi \cdot (1.0^2) = 3.14 \, m^2 \).
   - **Drogue Parachute**: Diameter of 0.5 m to provide initial deceleration.
     - \( cd_s = \pi \cdot (0.25^2) = 0.196 \, m^2 \).
   - **Deployment Trigger**: Both parachutes will deploy at apogee.

6. **Launch Configuration**:
   - **Rail Length**: 3.0 m for stability at launch.
   - **Inclination**: 90 degrees to achieve maximum altitude directly.
   - **Heading**: 0 degrees for a straight upward trajectory.

7. **Payload**:
   - **Mass**: 0.5 kg located 0.75 m from the bottom to ensure stability during flight.
