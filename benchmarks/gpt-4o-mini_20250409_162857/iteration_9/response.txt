Given the results from previous attempts, let's refine the design by carefully selecting components that enhance performance while adhering to the constraints. We will focus on achieving a balance between thrust and weight, ensuring safe landing conditions, and optimizing costs.

### Design Strategy

1. **Motor Selection**:
   - We need a motor that provides enough thrust and impulse for responsible ascent. I will aim for a motor that allows for controlled ascents to achieve the target apogee without excessive overshooting.

2. **Rocket Body**:
   - The choice of radius, length, material, and thickness will impact the rocket's weight, structural integrity, and overall aerodynamic performance.

3. **Nose Cone**:
   - An efficient shape (like ogive) will minimize aerodynamic drag during flight.

4. **Fin Design**:
   - Properly designed fins will enhance stability while minimizing weight.

5. **Parachute Specifications**:
   - Ensure the parachutes provide a safe landing at less than 5 m/s.

6. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Configured for a stable launch trajectory to maximize altitude gain.

### Optimized Design

#### 1. Motor Selection:
   - **Motor**: **CesaroniO5800**
   - **Thrust**: 6395.5 N
   - **Total Impulse**: 30382.7 Ns
   - **Burn Time**: 5.2 s
   - **Rationale**: This motor delivers a high level of thrust and total impulse, which helps achieve the target apogee effectively while still maintaining control.

#### 2. Rocket Body:
   - **Radius**: 0.16 m (greater than the motor's radius of 0.15 m).
   - **Length**: 1.5 m for stability during ascent.
   - **Material**: **Composite**, which provides an optimal balance of strength and weight.
   - **Thickness**: 0.005 m for structural integrity.

#### 3. Nose Cone:
   - **Shape**: **Ogive** to ensure minimal drag.
   - **Length**: 0.5 m for a good aerodynamic profile.
   - **Material**: **Composite**, consistent with the body for uniformity.

#### 4. Fin Design:
   - **Number of Fins**: 4 fins for stability.
   - **Dimensions**:
     - Root Chord: 0.12 m
     - Tip Chord: 0.06 m
     - Span: 0.25 m
   - **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees for vertical stability.
   - **Material**: **Carbon fiber** for its lightweight and high strength.

#### 5. Parachute Specifications:
   - **Main Parachute**: Diameter of **2.0 m**.
     - \( cd_s \) area = \( \pi \cdot (1.0^2) \approx 3.14 \, m^2\).
   - **Drogue Parachute**: Diameter of **0.5 m**.
     - \( cd_s \) area = \( \pi \cdot (0.25^2) \approx 0.196 \, m^2\).
   - **Trigger**: Both parachutes will deploy at apogee.

#### 6. Launch Configuration:
   - **Rail Length**: 3.0 m for stability during launch.
   - **Inclination**: 90 degrees (for direct vertical launch).
   - **Heading**: 0 degrees (to launch straight upwards).

#### 7. Payload:
   - **Mass**: 0.5 kg located at 0.75 m from the base to ensure stability.
