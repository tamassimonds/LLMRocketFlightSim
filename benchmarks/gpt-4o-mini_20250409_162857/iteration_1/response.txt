To design a rocket that meets the given requirements and constraints, we need to consider various factors such as motor selection, body dimensions, materials, fins, parachute specifications, and launch configuration. Here's the reasoning behind each design choice made for the rocket.

### 1. Motor Selection
Given the target apogee of **3048.0 meters**, we need a motor that can provide sufficient thrust and total impulse. 

After analyzing the available motors:
- **CesaroniO5800** offers the highest total impulse (30382.7 Ns) and sufficient thrust (6395.5 N). This motor is a strong candidate since it can propel the rocket high enough to achieve the target apogee and overcome atmospheric drag. The specific impulse (Isp) of 222 seconds is also favorable for higher efficiency.

### 2. Rocket Body
- **Radius**: The radius must be greater than the motor's radius. The motor diameter is 150 mm (0.15 m), so the body radius needs to be at least 0.16 m to ensure proper fit.
- **Length**: A length of 1.5 m provides enough structural integrity while keeping the overall weight manageable.
- **Material**: Choosing **fiberglass** is a good balance between weight, strength, and cost. It is commonly used in rocket construction for its durability.

### 3. Nose Cone Design
- **Shape**: An **ogive** shape is optimal for reducing drag.
- **Length**: A length of 0.5 m helps maintain aerodynamic efficiency.
- **Material**: **Fiberglass** will be consistent with the body, offering a lightweight structure.

### 4. Fin Design
- **Number of Fins**: Four fins provide stability during flight.
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Root chord: 0.1 m
  - Tip chord: 0.05 m
  - Span: 0.25 m
- **Cant Angle**: A cant angle of 0 degrees for a vertical orientation.
- **Material**: **Carbon fiber** is chosen for fins due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, aiding in overall performance.

### 5. Parachute Specifications
- **Main Parachute**: Diameter of 2.0 m for sufficient drag during descent.
- **Drogue Parachute**: Diameter of 0.5 m for initial stabilization and slowing during descent.
- **Trigger**: Both parachutes will deploy at apogee.
- **Noise**: Some variability in deployment timing is simulated with random noise values.

### 6. Launch Configuration
- **Rail Length**: A length of 3.0 m is sufficient for a smooth launch.
- **Inclination**: Set to 90 degrees (vertical launch) to achieve maximum altitude initially.
- **Heading**: Set to 0 degrees for a straight-up launch trajectory.

### Final Design
Now we compile all these choices into a dictionary format suitable for simulation software:
