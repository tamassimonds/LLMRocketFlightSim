To design a rocket that meets the target apogee of 3048.0 meters while ensuring a safe landing, minimal costs, and high performance, let’s analyze and optimize each component once more. Given the previous attempts and their outcomes, we’ll refine the components to achieve better performance metrics.

### Design Considerations
1. **Motor Selection**: We aim for a motor with a good balance between thrust and burn time to achieve controlled ascent without overshooting.
2. **Rocket Body**: The body dimensions and material must optimize the weight-to-strength ratio.
3. **Nose Cone Design**: Should reduce drag effectively during both ascent and descent.
4. **Fin Design**: Supporting stability while being lightweight.
5. **Parachute Specifications**: Must ensure a safe landing below 5 m/s.
6. **Launch Configuration**: Straight launch trajectory for optimal altitude gain.

### Design Decisions
1. **Motor Selection**
   - **Chosen Motor**: **CesaroniO5800** 
     - **Parameters**: 
       - Thrust: 6395.5 N 
       - Total Impulse: 30382.7 Ns 
       - Burn Time: 5.2 s 
       - Isp: 222 s
   - **Reasoning**: This motor delivers a high level of thrust and total impulse, which makes it suitable for reaching the target apogee without causing wild overshooting.

2. **Rocket Body**
   - **Radius**: 0.16 m (to allow sufficient clearance from the motor's radius of 0.15 m).
   - **Length**: 1.5 m, optimizing both structural integrity and minimizing weight.
   - **Material**: **Composite** – offers a good strength-to-weight ratio, ideal for aerospace applications.
   - **Thickness**: 0.005 m for structural reliability without excessive weight.

3. **Nose Cone Design**
   - **Shape**: **Ogive** for reduced drag during ascent and descent.
   - **Length**: 0.5 m for optimal aerodynamic performance.
   - **Material**: **Composite** (to match the body material for uniformity).

4. **Fin Design**
   - **Number of Fins**: 4 for balanced stability.
   - **Dimensions**: 
     - Root Chord: 0.12 m 
     - Tip Chord: 0.06 m 
     - Span: 0.25 m 
   - **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees for vertical stability.
   - **Material**: **Carbon fiber** to minimize weight while ensuring strength.

5. **Parachute Specifications**
   - **Main Parachute**: Diameter of 2.0 m for adequate drag.
     - \( cd_s \) area = \( \pi \cdot (1.0^2) = 3.14 \, m^2 \).
   - **Drogue Parachute**: Diameter of 0.7 m for initial stabilization and slowing down.
     - \( cd_s \) area = \( \pi \cdot (0.35^2) = 0.384 \, m^2 \).
   - **Deployment Trigger**: Both parachutes will deploy at apogee.

6. **Launch Configuration**
   - **Rail Length**: 3.0 m for a stable launch platform.
   - **Inclination**: 90 degrees (vertical for maximum altitude).
   - **Heading**: 0 degrees (to launch straight upwards).
  
7. **Payload**
   - **Mass**: 0.5 kg centered at \( 0.75 m \) for stability in the CM.

### Summary of Design
This optimized design utilizes a powerful motor with high thrust and impulse capabilities, ensuring the rocket can ascend effectively to the target apogee while also being designed with attention to safety and cost. Using a composite material unifies the strength across the structure while maintaining lightweight properties. The parachute designs take into account safe landing specifications, making this configuration a well-rounded approach for accomplishing the mission objectives.

### Expected Performance
By carefully crafting this design, it should perform closer to the target apogee without going excessively over, minimizing the risk of a failed flight and ensuring a safe landing. This should yield a significantly improved score compared to previous attempts in terms of accuracy to the target altitude, safety during landing, and structural integrity, all while minimizing costs.
