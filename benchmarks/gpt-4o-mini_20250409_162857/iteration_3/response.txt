To improve upon the previous rocket designs and effectively reach the target apogee of 3048.0 meters while ensuring a safe landing and minimizing costs, we must revisit all components with a focus on balancing thrust, weight, aerodynamics, materials, and safe parachute deployment. 

### Key Considerations

1. **Motor Selection**: We need a motor capable of delivering enough thrust and total impulse while maintaining a reasonable burn time. 
2. **Rocket Body**: Geometry and materials affect weight, structural integrity, and aerodynamics.
3. **Nose Cone Design**: Should be streamlined to reduce drag.
4. **Fin Design**: Fins provide stability during flight and need to be optimized for weight and strength.
5. **Parachute Specifications**: Ensure the parachutes effectively decelerate the rocket safely.
6. **Launch Configuration**: Needs to support the overall design and provide stability during launch.

### 1. Motor Selection
After analyzing the current motors:
- Let's choose the **Pro75M1670**. With 2200 N thrust, 6023.6 Ns total impulse, an Isp of 198 s, and a burn time of 3.9 seconds, this motor provides sufficient thrust for a higher apogee while keeping weights manageable.

### 2. Rocket Body
- **Radius**: A body radius of **0.1 m** ensures it is comfortably larger than the motor's 0.075 m.
- **Length**: Opting for a length of **1.5 m** balances structural integrity and aerodynamic efficiency.
- **Material**: **Fiberglass** is selected for its good balance of strength and weight, ensuring cost-efficiency and durability. 

### 3. Nose Cone Design
- **Shape**: An **ogive** shape is optimal for minimizing drag and is typically used in aerospace applications.
- **Length**: I propose a nose cone length of **0.4 m** - long enough to maintain efficiency but not too heavy.
- **Material**: The nose cone will also use the same **fiberglass** for uniformity.

### 4. Fin Design
- **Number of Fins**: I will use **4 fins** for good stability.
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Root Chord: **0.15 m**
  - Tip Chord: **0.075 m**
  - Span: **0.3 m**
- **Cant Angle**: Keeping the cant angle at **0 degrees** for a straight design.
- **Material**: **Honeycomb composite** is chosen for fins as it provides high strength-to-weight ratio while being lightweight for decreased overall mass. 

### 5. Parachute Specifications
For safe landing:
- **Main Parachute**: Diameter of **2.0 m** for effective drag during the descent.
- **Drogue Parachute**: Diameter of **0.7 m** for effective initial deceleration.
- **Trigger**: Both parachutes will deploy at apogee.
- **Noise and Lag**: Standard values for realistic simulation.

### 6. Launch Configuration
- **Rail Length**: A length of **3.0 m** remains suitable.
- **Inclination**: Kept at **90 degrees** (straight up) for optimal ascent.
- **Heading**: Set at **0 degrees** to launch straight upwards.

### Summary
This design improves upon previous attempts by utilizing the strengths of materials and aerodynamic shapes while ensuring sufficient thrust and safety. The redesigned parachute specifications aim for a safer landing, and careful consideration has been given to all metrics including structural integrity and cost considerations. 

By carefully choosing each element, this configuration should yield a refined performance aligned with our goals, potentially enhancing the score substantially.
