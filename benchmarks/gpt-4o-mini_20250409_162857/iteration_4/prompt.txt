# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
To design a rocket that meets the given requirements and constraints, we need to consider various factors such as motor selection, body dimensions, materials, fins, parachute specifications, and launch configuration. Here's the reasoning behind each design choice made for the rocket.

### 1. Motor Selection
Given the target apogee of **3048.0 meters**, we need a motor that can provide sufficient thrust and total impulse. 

After analyzing the available motors:
- **CesaroniO5800** offers the highest total impulse (30382.7 Ns) and sufficient thrust (6395.5 N). This motor is a strong candidate since it can propel the rocket high enough to achieve the target apogee and overcome atmospheric drag. The specific impulse (Isp) of 222 seconds is also favorable for higher efficiency.

### 2. Rocket Body
- **Radius**: The radius must be greater than the motor's radius. The motor diameter is 150 mm (0.15 m), so the body radius needs to be at least 0.16 m to ensure proper fit.
- **Length**: A length of 1.5 m provides enough structural integrity while keeping the overall weight manageable.
- **Material**: Choosing **fiberglass** is a good balance between weight, strength, and cost. It is commonly used in rocket construction for its durability.

### 3. Nose Cone Design
- **Shape**: An **ogive** shape is optimal for reducing drag.
- **Length**: A length of 0.5 m helps maintain aerodynamic efficiency.
- **Material**: **Fiberglass** will be consistent with the body, offering a lightweight structure.

### 4. Fin Design
- **Number of Fins**: Four fins provide stability during flight.
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Root chord: 0.1 m
  - Tip chord: 0.05 m
  - Span: 0.25 m
- **Cant Angle**: A cant angle of 0 degrees for a vertical orientation.
- **Material**: **Carbon fiber** is chosen for fins due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, aiding in overall performance.

### 5. Parachute Specifications
- **Main Parachute**: Diameter of 2.0 m for sufficient drag during descent.
- **Drogue Parachute**: Diameter of 0.5 m for initial stabilization and slowing during descent.
- **Trigger**: Both parachutes will deploy at apogee.
- **Noise**: Some variability in deployment timing is simulated with random noise values.

### 6. Launch Configuration
- **Rail Length**: A length of 3.0 m is sufficient for a smooth launch.
- **Inclination**: Set to 90 degrees (vertical launch) to achieve maximum altitude initially.
- **Heading**: Set to 0 degrees for a straight-up launch trajectory.

### Final Design
Now we compile all these choices into a dictionary format suitable for simulation software:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "CesaroniO5800",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.16,  # Body radius in meters

            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 3.0,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 90,    # Rail inclination in degrees (vertical)

        "mass": 0.5,  # Payload mass in kg

    }
}
```

### Summary

The configuration maintains realistic design limits while attacking the performance goals outlined in the task.
Score: 72.65/100

Cost: $1723.99

--- ATTEMPT 2 ---
Design:
To improve upon the previous rocket design while meeting all requirements and constraints, I'll analyze each component with the goal of optimizing performance, safety, and cost.

### Key Considerations
- The target apogee is 3048.0 meters. We need to ensure we design to reach this altitude without overshooting excessively.
- The rocket must land safely at less than 5 m/s to receive a higher score.
- Cost must be minimized while ensuring structural integrity and suitable performance.

### 1. Motor Selection
We need a motor that achieves a balance of thrust, burn time, and total impulse. The following motor appears to be a good candidate:

- **Pro75M1670**: 
  - Thrust: 2200 N
  - Total Impulse: 6023.6 Ns
  - Isp: 198 s

The Pro75M1670 provides sufficient thrust over a burn time of 3.9 seconds, which is good for controlling ascent and achieving apogee close to our target.

### 2. Rocket Body
- **Radius**: We need the body radius to be larger than the motor's radius (75 mm or 0.075 m). A radius of **0.08 m** (80 mm) ensures a proper fit.
- **Length**: A length of **1.0 m** will be considered, matching flight stability and aerodynamic considerations.
- **Material**: **Aluminum** is chosen for a good balance of lightweight and structural integrity.

### 3. Nose Cone Design
- **Shape**: An **ogive shape** will minimize drag effectively.
- **Length**: **0.4 m** provides a good trade-off between aerodynamic efficiency and structural stability.
- **Material**: Also using **aluminum** to ensure consistency in strength.

### 4. Fin Design
- **Number of Fins**: Retaining **4 fins** for stability.
- **Dimensions**:
  - Root Chord: **0.12 m**
  - Tip Chord: **0.06 m**
  - Span: **0.3 m**
- **Cant Angle**: Setting at **0 degrees** for vertical alignment helps stability during ascent.
- **Material**: **Carbon Fiber** offers a weight-saving option while ensuring strength.

### 5. Parachute Specifications
For safety during descent:
- **Main Parachute**: 
  - Diameter of **1.5 m** to slow down descent effectively.
  - Drag Coefficient Area \(cd_s\): \(π * (0.75^2) ≈ 1.767 m^2\).
- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - Diameter of **0.8 m** for initial stabilization.
  - Drag Coefficient Area \(cd_s\): \(π * (0.4^2) ≈ 0.502 m^2\).
- **Trigger**: Both will deploy at apogee.

### 6. Launch Configuration
- **Rail Length**: Set to **3.0 m** to ensure a stable launch.
- **Inclination**: **90 degrees** (vertical launch).
- **Heading**: **0 degrees**, launching directly upwards.

### Payload
- A payload mass of **0.5 kg** situated at **0.5 m** from the bottom helps maintain weight distribution.

### Final Design
Putting this all together in the specified format, we have:

### Summary
The new configuration looks to achieve the target apogee of 3048.0 meters with improved calculations, materials, and safety features included in the design. The use of aluminum provides a weight-efficient structural solution while carbon fiber for the fins enhances performance. The estimated cost will also be lower than prior attempts. This configuration should yield a higher score, maintaining safety and performance within the prescribed limits.

--- ATTEMPT 3 ---
Design:
To improve upon the previous rocket designs and effectively reach the target apogee of 3048.0 meters while ensuring a safe landing and minimizing costs, we must revisit all components with a focus on balancing thrust, weight, aerodynamics, materials, and safe parachute deployment. 

### Key Considerations

1. **Motor Selection**: We need a motor capable of delivering enough thrust and total impulse while maintaining a reasonable burn time. 
2. **Rocket Body**: Geometry and materials affect weight, structural integrity, and aerodynamics.
3. **Nose Cone Design**: Should be streamlined to reduce drag.
4. **Fin Design**: Fins provide stability during flight and need to be optimized for weight and strength.
5. **Parachute Specifications**: Ensure the parachutes effectively decelerate the rocket safely.
6. **Launch Configuration**: Needs to support the overall design and provide stability during launch.

### 1. Motor Selection
After analyzing the current motors:
- Let's choose the **Pro75M1670**. With 2200 N thrust, 6023.6 Ns total impulse, an Isp of 198 s, and a burn time of 3.9 seconds, this motor provides sufficient thrust for a higher apogee while keeping weights manageable.

### 2. Rocket Body
- **Radius**: A body radius of **0.1 m** ensures it is comfortably larger than the motor's 0.075 m.
- **Length**: Opting for a length of **1.5 m** balances structural integrity and aerodynamic efficiency.
- **Material**: **Fiberglass** is selected for its good balance of strength and weight, ensuring cost-efficiency and durability. 

### 3. Nose Cone Design
- **Shape**: An **ogive** shape is optimal for minimizing drag and is typically used in aerospace applications.
- **Length**: I propose a nose cone length of **0.4 m** - long enough to maintain efficiency but not too heavy.
- **Material**: The nose cone will also use the same **fiberglass** for uniformity.

### 4. Fin Design
- **Number of Fins**: I will use **4 fins** for good stability.
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Root Chord: **0.15 m**
  - Tip Chord: **0.075 m**
  - Span: **0.3 m**
- **Cant Angle**: Keeping the cant angle at **0 degrees** for a straight design.
- **Material**: **Honeycomb composite** is chosen for fins as it provides high strength-to-weight ratio while being lightweight for decreased overall mass. 

### 5. Parachute Specifications
For safe landing:
- **Main Parachute**: Diameter of **2.0 m** for effective drag during the descent.
- **Drogue Parachute**: Diameter of **0.7 m** for effective initial deceleration.
- **Trigger**: Both parachutes will deploy at apogee.
- **Noise and Lag**: Standard values for realistic simulation.

### 6. Launch Configuration
- **Rail Length**: A length of **3.0 m** remains suitable.
- **Inclination**: Kept at **90 degrees** (straight up) for optimal ascent.
- **Heading**: Set at **0 degrees** to launch straight upwards.
