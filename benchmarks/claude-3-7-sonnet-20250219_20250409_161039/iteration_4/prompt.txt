# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

# Rocket Design Analysis

## Initial Considerations

To design a rocket that reaches a target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) in a 5 m/s easterly wind, I need to balance several factors:

1. **Motor selection**: Must provide enough thrust to reach target apogee without excessive power
2. **Aerodynamic stability**: Proper center of pressure and center of gravity relationship
3. **Weight optimization**: Lighter materials where possible without compromising structural integrity
4. **Recovery system**: Safe landing speed (<5 m/s)
5. **Cost efficiency**: Lower cost improves score

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I'll analyze the available motors based on total impulse, which correlates with maximum altitude potential:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Impulse-to-Weight Ratio | Cost Factor |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------------|------------|
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | High | Very High |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | Medium | Very High |
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | High | Medium |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 0.732 | High | Low |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | Medium | Low |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 0.108 | Medium | Very Low |

For a 3048m apogee, the O-class motors are likely overkill and would increase cost significantly. The H-class motor is probably insufficient. The K and M class motors are more appropriate for our target altitude.

I'll select the **AeroTechK700W** as it offers a good balance of impulse and weight with lower cost than the M-class motors.

## Body Design Calculations

For a K-class motor, a moderate-sized body is appropriate:
- Motor radius: 54mm = 0.054m
- Body radius: I'll choose 0.075m (75mm) to accommodate the motor with clearance
- Length: ~1.0m for adequate stability and internal space
- Material: Fiberglass offers good strength-to-weight ratio at moderate cost

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Ogive provides good aerodynamic performance
- Length: ~0.25m (typical ratio to body diameter is 3:1)
- Material: ABS_plastic for cost efficiency while maintaining adequate strength

## Fin Design

For stability, the center of pressure must be behind the center of gravity:
- Number: 4 fins for stability
- Root chord: 0.15m
- Tip chord: 0.075m (2:1 taper ratio)
- Span: 0.12m
- Material: Balsa_wood (lightweight, cost-effective)
- Thickness: 0.006m

## Parachute Sizing

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s), I need to calculate appropriate parachute sizes:

Estimated rocket mass: ~2.5kg (motor + structure + payload)

For terminal velocity v = 5 m/s:
CD_S = 2mg/(ρv²) = 2 × 2.5 × 9.81/(1.225 × 5²) ≈ 0.8

I'll split this between main and drogue parachutes:
- Main: CD_S = 0.65 (for primary descent)
- Drogue: CD_S = 0.15 (for initial stabilization)

## Launch Configuration

- Rail length: 1.0m for stable initial guidance
- Inclination: 85° (slightly angled into the wind to compensate for drift)
- Heading: 270° (west, opposite to the easterly wind)

## Final Design Configuration

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "AeroTechK700W",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.075,  # Body radius in meters

            "length": 0.2,  # Tail length in meters
            "top_radius": 0.065,  # Top radius in meters
            "bottom_radius": 0.075,  # Bottom radius in meters
            "material": "balsa_wood",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 0.65,  # Main parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,

            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.15,  # Drogue parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.0,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 85,   # Rail inclination in degrees (slightly angled into wind)

    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.3  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design balances performance requirements with cost efficiency. The K-class motor provides adequate thrust without excessive cost, while the lightweight materials (balsa wood fins, ABS nose cone) keep the overall weight down. The parachute system is sized to ensure a safe landing speed below 5 m/s, and the launch configuration accounts for the easterly wind to minimize horizontal drift.

Design:
# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Design Approach and Reasoning

I need to design a rocket that will reach exactly 3048m (10,000 ft) in a 5 m/s easterly wind, while minimizing cost, ensuring structural integrity, achieving a safe landing speed, and minimizing horizontal drift.

### Motor Selection Analysis

First, I'll analyze the available motors based on their total impulse and mass characteristics:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Avg Thrust (N) | Burn Time (s) | Cost Factor |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | 5040.2 | 5.2 | Very High |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | 2836.9 | 8.2 | Very High |
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | 1533.9 | 3.9 | Medium |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | 1533.9 | 3.6 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 0.732 | 658.7 | 3.5 | Low |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | 190.2 | 9.7 | Low |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 0.108 | 141.2 | 1.29 | Very Low |

The previous attempt with AeroTechK700W reached only 1669m, which is significantly below our target. We need more impulse but must avoid structural failure. The Pro75M1670 offers a good balance with moderate mass and sufficient impulse to reach our target altitude.

### Structural Considerations

The previous design failed structurally. To address this:
- Increase body wall thickness
- Use stronger materials where needed
- Ensure proper sizing of components relative to expected forces

### Weight and Aerodynamic Optimization

- Balancing weight: Heavier rocket needs more impulse but provides stability
- Aerodynamic efficiency: Streamlined design reduces drag
- Stability: Center of pressure must be behind center of gravity

## Detailed Design Calculations

### Estimated Mass Budget
- Motor (Pro75M1670): 1.815 kg
- Body structure: ~1.0 kg
- Nose cone: ~0.2 kg
- Fins and tail: ~0.3 kg
- Payload: 0.4 kg
- Total estimated mass: ~3.7 kg

### Parachute Sizing for Safe Landing
For terminal velocity v = 5 m/s with estimated mass of 3.7 kg:
CD_S = 2mg/(ρv²) = 2 × 3.7 × 9.81/(1.225 × 5²) ≈ 1.18

Split between main and drogue:
- Main: CD_S = 0.9
- Drogue: CD_S = 0.28

### Launch Configuration
- Angling slightly against the wind (85° inclination)
- Heading west (270°) to counteract easterly wind drift

            "lag": 1.5,

        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.5,  # Increased rail length for better initial stability
        "inclination": 85,   # Rail inclination in degrees (slightly angled into wind)

    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.4,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.4  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design addresses the previous failure by:
1. Using a more powerful motor (Pro75M1670) to reach the target altitude
2. Strengthening the structure with thicker walls and stronger materials
3. Properly sizing the parachutes for a safe landing speed
4. Optimizing the launch configuration to account for wind
5. Maintaining a reasonable cost by avoiding the most expensive O-class motors
6. Ensuring proper aerodynamic stability with appropriate fin design

The Pro75M1670 motor provides sufficient impulse to reach our target altitude while maintaining a reasonable weight and cost. The structural components have been strengthened to prevent failure, and the parachute system is sized to ensure a safe landing speed below 5 m/s.

Design:
# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Design Approach and Reasoning

Looking at the previous attempts, I can see that:
1. The first attempt with AeroTechK700W reached only 1669m (45% below target) and failed structurally
2. The second attempt with Pro75M1670 reached 2661m (13% below target) and passed structural integrity

For this improved design, I need to:
- Increase apogee to exactly 3048m (currently undershooting)
- Maintain structural integrity
- Optimize cost (second attempt was $673.31)
- Ensure safe landing speed (<5 m/s)
- Minimize horizontal drift

## Motor Selection Refinement

The Pro75M1670 motor got us closer to our target but still undershot by ~13%. I have two options:
1. Keep the same motor but reduce weight/drag
2. Use a slightly more powerful motor

Since we're still significantly under our target, I'll select the CesaroniM1670 which has the same total impulse (6023.6 Ns) as Pro75M1670 but with different burn characteristics that might help us reach our target altitude.

## Weight Optimization

To reach a higher apogee with the same impulse class:
- Reduce body length slightly (1.2m → 1.1m)
- Use lighter materials where structural integrity permits
- Optimize fin size to reduce drag while maintaining stability

## Structural Integrity Considerations

The second attempt passed structural integrity tests, so I'll maintain:
- Adequate wall thickness (0.005m)
- Strong materials for critical components
- Proper sizing of aerodynamic surfaces

## Parachute Sizing Recalculation

With slightly reduced weight (estimated ~3.5kg vs previous 3.7kg):
CD_S = 2mg/(ρv²) = 2 × 3.5 × 9.81/(1.225 × 5²) ≈ 1.12

Split between main and drogue:
- Main: CD_S = 0.85
- Drogue: CD_S = 0.27

## Launch Configuration Adjustment

To account for the 5 m/s easterly wind:
- Maintain inclination at 85° (slightly angled into the wind)
- Keep heading at 270° (west, opposite to the easterly wind)
- Increase rail length slightly for better initial stability

This design improves upon the previous attempt by:

1. Using the CesaroniM1670 motor which has the same total impulse as Pro75M1670 but different burn characteristics
2. Reducing overall weight by slightly decreasing dimensions of body, nose cone, and fins
3. Maintaining structural integrity with adequate material thickness and strength
4. Properly sizing the parachutes for a safe landing speed
5. Optimizing the launch configuration for wind conditions
6. Balancing performance with cost considerations

The CesaroniM1670 motor should provide the necessary impulse to reach our target altitude of 3048m, while the structural components remain robust enough to prevent failure. The parachute system is sized to ensure a safe landing speed below 5 m/s, and the aerodynamic design is optimized for stability and performance.
