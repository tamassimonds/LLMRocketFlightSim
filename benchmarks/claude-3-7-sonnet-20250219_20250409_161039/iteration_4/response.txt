# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Looking at the three previous attempts:

1. **Attempt 1**: AeroTechK700W motor - Reached 1669m (45% below target), failed structurally, cost $224.82
2. **Attempt 2**: Pro75M1670 motor - Reached 2661m (13% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $673.31
3. **Attempt 3**: CesaroniM1670 motor - Reached 2447m (20% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $690.82

The key insights:
- We need more impulse than provided by the K-class motors
- The M-class motors are getting closer but still undershooting
- Structural integrity is achievable with proper materials and thicknesses
- We need to optimize the weight-to-impulse ratio

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

The Pro75M1670 got us closest to our target. Since we're still undershooting, we need either:
1. More impulse from a more powerful motor
2. Significantly reduced weight and drag

Let's try the AeroTechK700W again but with a much more optimized design to reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity. This motor is significantly cheaper than the M-class motors, which will improve our cost score.

## Weight and Drag Optimization Strategy

To reach a higher apogee with the K-class motor:
- Use minimum viable body dimensions
- Select lightweight but strong materials
- Optimize fin design for minimal drag
- Reduce payload mass to minimum
- Ensure aerodynamic efficiency

## Structural Integrity Considerations

To maintain structural integrity while reducing weight:
- Use composite materials where possible (strong but lightweight)
- Maintain adequate wall thickness
- Design fins for both aerodynamic efficiency and strength

## Detailed Design Calculations

### Estimated Mass Budget
- Motor (AeroTechK700W): 0.732 kg
- Body structure: ~0.5 kg (lightweight composite)
- Nose cone: ~0.1 kg
- Fins and tail: ~0.2 kg
- Payload: 0.2 kg
- Total estimated mass: ~1.7 kg (significantly lighter than previous attempts)

### Parachute Sizing for Safe Landing
For terminal velocity v = 5 m/s with estimated mass of 1.7 kg:
CD_S = 2mg/(ρv²) = 2 × 1.7 × 9.81/(1.225 × 5²) ≈ 0.54

Split between main and drogue:
- Main: CD_S = 0.44
- Drogue: CD_S = 0.1

This design represents a significant optimization over previous attempts:

1. **Weight Reduction**: Using lightweight but strong materials (composite, carbon fiber) and minimizing dimensions to reduce overall weight
2. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Using a von Karman nose cone for better aerodynamic performance and optimized fin design
3. **Structural Integrity**: Maintaining adequate thickness and using strong materials to ensure the rocket doesn't fail structurally
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Using the AeroTechK700W motor which is significantly cheaper than M-class motors
5. **Recovery System**: Properly sized parachutes for the lighter rocket to ensure safe landing
6. **Launch Configuration**: Optimized for the wind conditions to minimize horizontal drift

By significantly reducing weight and drag while maintaining structural integrity, this design aims to achieve the target apogee of 3048m with the more cost-effective K-class motor. The lightweight materials and optimized dimensions should allow the rocket to reach a higher altitude than previous attempts with the same motor.
