# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Design Approach and Reasoning

I need to design a rocket that will reach exactly 3048m (10,000 ft) in a 5 m/s easterly wind, while minimizing cost, ensuring structural integrity, achieving a safe landing speed, and minimizing horizontal drift.

### Motor Selection Analysis

First, I'll analyze the available motors based on their total impulse and mass characteristics:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Avg Thrust (N) | Burn Time (s) | Cost Factor |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | 5040.2 | 5.2 | Very High |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | 2836.9 | 8.2 | Very High |
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | 1533.9 | 3.9 | Medium |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | 1533.9 | 3.6 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 0.732 | 658.7 | 3.5 | Low |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | 190.2 | 9.7 | Low |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 0.108 | 141.2 | 1.29 | Very Low |

The previous attempt with AeroTechK700W reached only 1669m, which is significantly below our target. We need more impulse but must avoid structural failure. The Pro75M1670 offers a good balance with moderate mass and sufficient impulse to reach our target altitude.

### Structural Considerations

The previous design failed structurally. To address this:
- Increase body wall thickness
- Use stronger materials where needed
- Ensure proper sizing of components relative to expected forces

### Weight and Aerodynamic Optimization

- Balancing weight: Heavier rocket needs more impulse but provides stability
- Aerodynamic efficiency: Streamlined design reduces drag
- Stability: Center of pressure must be behind center of gravity

## Detailed Design Calculations

### Estimated Mass Budget
- Motor (Pro75M1670): 1.815 kg
- Body structure: ~1.0 kg
- Nose cone: ~0.2 kg
- Fins and tail: ~0.3 kg
- Payload: 0.4 kg
- Total estimated mass: ~3.7 kg

### Parachute Sizing for Safe Landing
For terminal velocity v = 5 m/s with estimated mass of 3.7 kg:
CD_S = 2mg/(ρv²) = 2 × 3.7 × 9.81/(1.225 × 5²) ≈ 1.18

Split between main and drogue:
- Main: CD_S = 0.9
- Drogue: CD_S = 0.28

### Launch Configuration
- Angling slightly against the wind (85° inclination)
- Heading west (270°) to counteract easterly wind drift

}
```

This design addresses the previous failure by:
1. Using a more powerful motor (Pro75M1670) to reach the target altitude
2. Strengthening the structure with thicker walls and stronger materials
3. Properly sizing the parachutes for a safe landing speed
4. Optimizing the launch configuration to account for wind
5. Maintaining a reasonable cost by avoiding the most expensive O-class motors
6. Ensuring proper aerodynamic stability with appropriate fin design

The Pro75M1670 motor provides sufficient impulse to reach our target altitude while maintaining a reasonable weight and cost. The structural components have been strengthened to prevent failure, and the parachute system is sized to ensure a safe landing speed below 5 m/s.
