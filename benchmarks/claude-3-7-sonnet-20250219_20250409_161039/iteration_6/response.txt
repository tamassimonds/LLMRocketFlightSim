# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Analyzing the five previous attempts reveals important patterns:

1. **Attempt 1**: AeroTechK700W - 1669m (45% below target), failed structurally, cost $224.82
2. **Attempt 2**: Pro75M1670 - 2661m (13% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $673.31
3. **Attempt 3**: CesaroniM1670 - 2447m (20% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $690.82
4. **Attempt 4**: AeroTechK700W (optimized) - 2257m (26% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $256.51
5. **Attempt 5**: Pro75M1670 (optimized) - 2801m (8% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $655.65

Key insights:
- The Pro75M1670 motor has gotten us closest to our target (8% below)
- We need to further reduce weight and drag to increase apogee
- Structural integrity can be maintained with proper materials and dimensions
- The best score so far is 52.89/100 with the Pro75M1670 optimized design

## Motor Selection and Optimization Strategy

Since the Pro75M1670 got us closest to our target, I'll continue with this motor but make further optimizations:
1. Further reduce body length and weight
2. Optimize aerodynamic surfaces for minimal drag
3. Use the lightest viable materials while maintaining structural integrity
4. Fine-tune the launch angle to account for wind

## Detailed Design Calculations

### Estimated Mass Budget
- Motor (Pro75M1670): 1.815 kg
- Body structure: ~0.55 kg (further optimized)
- Nose cone: ~0.12 kg
- Fins and tail: ~0.18 kg (carbon fiber)
- Payload: 0.15 kg (minimized)
- Total estimated mass: ~2.82 kg (lighter than previous attempts)

### Parachute Sizing for Safe Landing
For terminal velocity v = 5 m/s with estimated mass of 2.82 kg:
CD_S = 2mg/(ρv²) = 2 × 2.82 × 9.81/(1.225 × 5²) ≈ 0.9

Split between main and drogue:
- Main: CD_S = 0.7
- Drogue: CD_S = 0.2

```

This design represents a further optimization over the previous best attempt:

1. **Material Selection**: Using carbon fiber throughout for maximum strength-to-weight ratio
2. **Weight Reduction**: Further reducing dimensions and wall thickness while maintaining structural integrity
3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Maintaining the von Karman nose cone and optimized 3-fin design
4. **Structural Considerations**: Carefully balancing weight reduction with structural requirements
5. **Recovery System**: Properly sized parachutes for the lighter rocket to ensure safe landing
6. **Launch Configuration**: Slightly more vertical launch angle to maximize altitude

By making these incremental improvements to our best design so far, I aim to reach the exact target apogee of 3048m. The Pro75M1670 motor has proven to be the most suitable for our target, and with these final optimizations, we should be able to close the remaining 8% gap to our target altitude while maintaining structural integrity and minimizing cost.
