# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Analyzing the six previous attempts reveals important patterns:

1. **Attempt 1**: AeroTechK700W - 1669m (45% below target), failed structurally, cost $224.82
2. **Attempt 2**: Pro75M1670 - 2661m (13% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $673.31
3. **Attempt 3**: CesaroniM1670 - 2447m (20% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $690.82
4. **Attempt 4**: AeroTechK700W (optimized) - 2257m (26% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $256.51
5. **Attempt 5**: Pro75M1670 (optimized) - 2801m (8% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $655.65
6. **Attempt 6**: Pro75M1670 (further optimized) - 2794m (8% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $788.65

Key insights:
- The Pro75M1670 motor consistently gets us closest to our target (around 8% below)
- Carbon fiber increased cost in attempt 6 without improving performance
- We need more impulse to reach our target altitude
- The AeroTechK700W is insufficient even with optimization

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

Since we're consistently undershooting with the Pro75M1670, I'll try the CesaroniK700W motor which has more impulse (2249 Ns vs 1521.7 Ns for the CesaroniK160) while being more cost-effective than the M-class motors.

## Weight and Drag Optimization Strategy

To maximize altitude with the AeroTechK700W:
- Minimize body dimensions while maintaining structural integrity
- Use lightweight but strong materials (composite instead of carbon fiber for better cost-performance)
- Optimize fin design for minimal drag
- Reduce payload mass to minimum viable

## Detailed Design Calculations

### Estimated Mass Budget
- Motor (AeroTechK700W): 0.732 kg
- Body structure: ~0.4 kg (minimized)
- Nose cone: ~0.1 kg
- Fins and tail: ~0.15 kg
- Payload: 0.1 kg (minimized)
- Total estimated mass: ~1.5 kg (significantly lighter)

### Parachute Sizing for Safe Landing
For terminal velocity v = 5 m/s with estimated mass of 1.5 kg:
CD_S = 2mg/(ρv²) = 2 × 1.5 × 9.81/(1.225 × 5²) ≈ 0.48

Split between main and drogue:
- Main: CD_S = 0.38
- Drogue: CD_S = 0.1

This design represents a significant optimization for the AeroTechK700W motor:

1. **Extreme Weight Reduction**: Minimizing all dimensions and using lightweight composite materials
2. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Using a von Karman nose cone and minimalist 3-fin design
3. **Structural Integrity**: Carefully balancing weight reduction with structural requirements
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Using composite instead of carbon fiber for better cost-performance ratio
5. **Recovery System**: Properly sized parachutes for the lighter rocket to ensure safe landing
6. **Launch Configuration**: Nearly vertical launch angle to maximize altitude

By creating an extremely lightweight and aerodynamically efficient design, I aim to maximize the altitude achievable with the AeroTechK700W motor while keeping costs low. The focus is on minimizing weight and drag while maintaining structural integrity.
