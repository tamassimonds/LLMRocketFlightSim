# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing the seven previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns:

| Attempt | Motor | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Score |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | AeroTechK700W | 1669.09 | 45.24% | FAILED | 224.82 | 7.30 |
| 2 | Pro75M1670 | 2661.26 | 12.69% | PASSED | 673.31 | 45.09 |
| 3 | CesaroniM1670 | 2446.88 | 19.72% | PASSED | 690.82 | 35.34 |
| 4 | AeroTechK700W (opt) | 2257.30 | 25.94% | PASSED | 256.51 | 28.49 |
| 5 | Pro75M1670 (opt) | 2801.46 | 8.09% | PASSED | 655.65 | 52.89 |
| 6 | Pro75M1670 (carbon) | 2794.29 | 8.32% | PASSED | 788.65 | 52.46 |
| 7 | AeroTechK700W (min) | 2381.84 | 21.86% | PASSED | 232.59 | 32.82 |

Key insights:
- The Pro75M1670 motor consistently gets us closest to our target (best: 8.09% below)
- The K-class motors are more cost-effective but insufficient for our target altitude
- Attempt 5 achieved the best score (52.89) with Pro75M1670 and composite materials
- Carbon fiber (Attempt 6) increased cost without improving performance
- We need to increase thrust-to-weight ratio to reach our target altitude

## Strategic Approach for Final Design

Based on these insights, I'll use the CesaroniM1670 motor which has the same total impulse as Pro75M1670 (6023.6 Ns) but is slightly lighter (1.815 kg vs 3.101 kg). This should provide a better thrust-to-weight ratio while maintaining sufficient impulse.

I'll combine this with:
1. Extremely lightweight design using composite materials (not carbon fiber)
2. Minimized dimensions while maintaining structural integrity
3. Optimized aerodynamic surfaces for minimal drag
4. Precise launch angle adjustment to account for wind

## Detailed Design Calculations

### Estimated Mass Budget
- Motor (CesaroniM1670): 3.101 kg
- Body structure: ~0.45 kg (minimized composite)
- Nose cone: ~0.1 kg
- Fins and tail: ~0.15 kg
- Payload: 0.1 kg (minimized)
- Total estimated mass: ~3.9 kg

### Parachute Sizing for Safe Landing
For terminal velocity v = 5 m/s with estimated mass of 3.9 kg:
CD_S = 2mg/(ρv²) = 2 × 3.9 × 9.81/(1.225 × 5²) ≈ 1.25

Split between main and drogue:
- Main: CD_S = 1.0
- Drogue: CD_S = 0.25

```

This design represents a carefully optimized solution based on the lessons from all previous attempts:

1. **Motor Selection**: Using CesaroniM1670 which has the same total impulse as Pro75M1670 but with different burn characteristics that may help us reach our target altitude
2. **Weight Optimization**: Minimizing all dimensions and using lightweight composite materials throughout
3. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Using a von Karman nose cone and optimized 3-fin design for minimal drag
4. **Structural Integrity**: Carefully balancing weight reduction with structural requirements
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Using composite instead of carbon fiber for better cost-performance ratio
6. **Recovery System**: Properly sized parachutes for safe landing below 5 m/s
7. **Launch Configuration**: Nearly vertical launch angle to maximize altitude while accounting for wind

By combining the best elements from our previous attempts and making strategic adjustments, this design aims to achieve the target apogee of 3048m while maintaining structural integrity, ensuring safe landing, and optimizing cost.
