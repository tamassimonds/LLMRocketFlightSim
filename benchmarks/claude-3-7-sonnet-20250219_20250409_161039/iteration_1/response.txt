# Rocket Design Analysis

## Initial Considerations

To design a rocket that reaches a target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) in a 5 m/s easterly wind, I need to balance several factors:

1. **Motor selection**: Must provide enough thrust to reach target apogee without excessive power
2. **Aerodynamic stability**: Proper center of pressure and center of gravity relationship
3. **Weight optimization**: Lighter materials where possible without compromising structural integrity
4. **Recovery system**: Safe landing speed (<5 m/s)
5. **Cost efficiency**: Lower cost improves score

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I'll analyze the available motors based on total impulse, which correlates with maximum altitude potential:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Mass (kg) | Impulse-to-Weight Ratio | Cost Factor |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------------|------------|
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 12.418 | High | Very High |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 14.194 | Medium | Very High |
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1.815 | High | Medium |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 3.101 | Medium | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 0.732 | High | Low |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 0.7 | Medium | Low |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 0.108 | Medium | Very Low |

For a 3048m apogee, the O-class motors are likely overkill and would increase cost significantly. The H-class motor is probably insufficient. The K and M class motors are more appropriate for our target altitude.

I'll select the **AeroTechK700W** as it offers a good balance of impulse and weight with lower cost than the M-class motors.

## Body Design Calculations

For a K-class motor, a moderate-sized body is appropriate:
- Motor radius: 54mm = 0.054m
- Body radius: I'll choose 0.075m (75mm) to accommodate the motor with clearance
- Length: ~1.0m for adequate stability and internal space
- Material: Fiberglass offers good strength-to-weight ratio at moderate cost

## Nose Cone Design

- Shape: Ogive provides good aerodynamic performance
- Length: ~0.25m (typical ratio to body diameter is 3:1)
- Material: ABS_plastic for cost efficiency while maintaining adequate strength

## Fin Design

For stability, the center of pressure must be behind the center of gravity:
- Number: 4 fins for stability
- Root chord: 0.15m
- Tip chord: 0.075m (2:1 taper ratio)
- Span: 0.12m
- Material: Balsa_wood (lightweight, cost-effective)
- Thickness: 0.006m

## Parachute Sizing

For a safe landing speed (<5 m/s), I need to calculate appropriate parachute sizes:

Estimated rocket mass: ~2.5kg (motor + structure + payload)

For terminal velocity v = 5 m/s:
CD_S = 2mg/(ρv²) = 2 × 2.5 × 9.81/(1.225 × 5²) ≈ 0.8

I'll split this between main and drogue parachutes:
- Main: CD_S = 0.65 (for primary descent)
- Drogue: CD_S = 0.15 (for initial stabilization)

## Launch Configuration

- Rail length: 1.0m for stable initial guidance
- Inclination: 85° (slightly angled into the wind to compensate for drift)
- Heading: 270° (west, opposite to the easterly wind)

## Final Design Configuration

```

This design balances performance requirements with cost efficiency. The K-class motor provides adequate thrust without excessive cost, while the lightweight materials (balsa wood fins, ABS nose cone) keep the overall weight down. The parachute system is sized to ensure a safe landing speed below 5 m/s, and the launch configuration accounts for the easterly wind to minimize horizontal drift.
