Below is the thought process behind a further-optimized design, followed by the final Python dictionary configuration. The objective is to nudge the cost a bit lower than Attempt 6 (which was already close to the target altitude and structurally sound), maintain a safe margin on structural integrity, and retain a near-vertical launch to minimize horizontal drift.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Starting Point: Attempt 6
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Attempt 6 achieved an apogee within 0.05% of the 3048 m target.  
• It had a wall and fin thickness of 2.8 mm in fiberglass (body/tail) and plywood (fins), which passed structural checks.  
• The total cost was around $620.49.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) Reducing Cost Without Jeopardizing Safety
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Lowering thickness slightly shaves material cost and mass, but too thin can trigger structural failure under thrust.  
• Moving from 2.8 mm to 2.7 mm for both the rocket body and fins is a small step that may still preserve structural integrity.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Minor Adjustments to Recovery System
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Slightly decreasing the main parachute’s cd_s from 0.7 to 0.68 can reduce packing volume and possibly cost. As long as the rocket still lands under ~5 m/s, it remains safe.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) Launch Rail & Overall Dimensions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Keep the 1.3 m body length and 0.076 m body radius from Attempt 6, since they provided near-perfect altitude performance.  
• Reduce the launch rail length from 2.3 m to 2.2 m for marginal cost savings, trusting that the rocket remains stable at liftoff under high thrust.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) Final Expectation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• With only a slight reduction in thickness, a minor tweak to the parachute, and a slightly shorter rail, we anticipate the rocket remains near 3048 m apogee, keeps structural integrity, and lands gently at acceptable velocities. The cost should improve incrementally while preserving an excellent overall score.

Explanation Summary:
• By making small, careful adjustments to thickness, parachute size, and rail length, this design should remain very close to the 3048 m target apogee, keep the landing velocity well within safe limits, and modestly lower the overall cost compared to Attempt 6.
