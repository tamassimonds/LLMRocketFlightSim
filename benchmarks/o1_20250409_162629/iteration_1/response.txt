Below is a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the proposed design, followed by the actual configuration in the required Python dictionary format.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Motor Selection
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Goal: Reach approximately 3048 m (10,000 ft).  
• The AeroTech H128W is too small (total impulse ~176 Ns). This would almost certainly fall short of 3 km unless the rocket is extremely light, which risks structural failure.  
• The Cesaroni K160 (~1522 Ns) might get close to 3 km only if the rocket is kept very light (~2–2.5 kg). However, that leaves little mass margin for a sturdy fuselage and safe descent system, which can jeopardize recovery and structural reliability.  
• The AeroTech K700W (~2249 Ns) is a moderate motor that can comfortably loft a reasonably built rocket to around 3 km, without overdoing the total impulse as larger M or O motors might.  
• Therefore, the K700W provides a good compromise: enough impulse to reach the target with moderate rocket mass and minimized cost/complexity compared to the much larger M or O motors.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) Body Dimensions & Material
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Motor radius is 0.054 m, so the rocket body radius must exceed that. Choose 0.06 m for a bit of clearance.  
• Length of 1.4 m for the main body is a midrange choice: not so short that the rocket is aerodynamically unstable, but not so long that mass and cost grow unnecessarily.  
• Material selected as “fiberglass” for a good balance of strength, reliability, and cost. Thinner composites like carbon fiber can drive up costs, while something too light (balsa) wouldn’t be structurally adequate for high thrust.  
• A thickness of 0.003 m (3 mm) is enough to handle flight loads and remain relatively light.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Nose Cone
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Length: 0.25 m. A moderate choice for aerodynamic efficiency (not too blunt, not too long).  
• Shape: “ogive.” This is a common, practical profile for mid/high-power rockets.  
• Material: “fiberglass” to match the fuselage and keep manufacturing consistent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) Fins
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Choose 3 fins to reduce weight, max thrust loads, and cost (4 fins add weight and complexity).  
• Root chord of 0.18 m and tip chord of 0.09 m: a taper that provides good stability without becoming too large.  
• Span ~ 0.18 m: ensures stability margin and decent aerodynamic performance.  
• Cant angle = 0 degrees to keep construction simpler and reduce potential spin.  
• Material: “plywood” is inexpensive and sturdy enough for typical high-power flights. An extremely lightweight material like balsa might risk fin damage at K700 thrust levels; carbon fiber might be more expensive than needed.  
• Thickness: 0.003 m (3 mm) is typical for plywood fins at this size.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) Tail Section
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• A small tail “boat tail” can improve aerodynamics near the aft and protect the motor mount.  
• Length: 0.1 m.  
• Top radius: 0.06 m (matches rocket body).  
• Bottom radius: 0.05 m (slightly smaller, to avoid DRC error of top and bottom being equal).  
• Material: “fiberglass” to match the main tube.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) Parachutes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Two-parachute recovery (main + drogue) is typical for safer, slower landings and good altitude control.  
• “cd_s” is the product of drag coefficient and reference area.  
• Main parachute cd_s = 0.5 → sized to keep landing speed under ~5 m/s for a rocket in the 3–4 kg range.  
• Drogue cd_s = 0.05 → stabilizes the rocket during descent from apogee to main deployment but without extensive drag.  
• Both triggered at apogee in this simplified configuration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7) Launch Rail Configuration
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Rail length: 2.0 m, a typical length that ensures stable departure under the K700 thrust.  
• Inclination: 90° for a vertical launch. That typically minimizes horizontal drift in moderate winds, helping reduce the total horizontal distance.  
• Heading: 0°, indicating “straight up” in many simulators (heading often measured from north, but here we specify 0 as up per the example notes).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8) Payload
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• A small 0.3 kg payload to simulate instruments or sensors, placed well within the rocket body.  
• Position: 0.7 m from center ensures it’s forward enough to aid in a good center of gravity location.

This design balances using a moderately powered motor with reasonable body dimensions and materials, in hopes of achieving an apogee near 3048 m while keeping cost, complexity, and horizontal drift low.
