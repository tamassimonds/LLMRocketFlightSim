To design a rocket capable of reaching an apogee of 3048 meters under specified parameters and constraints, I will carefully select components and consider aerodynamics, stability, and safety during descent. The design will take into account the wind conditions and the rewards structure defined in the scoring function. 

### Motor Selection

From the available motors, I will choose the **CesaroniM1670** motor for the following reasons:

- **Max Thrust**: 2200 N which is sufficient to achieve a high apogee.
- **Total Impulse**: 6023.6 Ns, which provides a good amount of energy to reach the target altitude.
- **Cost**: $550, which is reasonable and keeps the expenditure within acceptable limits.
- The weight of the motor is 3.101 kg, which needs to be considered in the overall rocket weight.

### Body Dimensions and Material

I will use a **radius of 0.085m** (85mm) for the body, which is suitable given the motor radius of 0.075m, thus adhering to the requirement of being larger. A **length of 1.5m** is chosen to allow for a stable aerodynamic profile while providing sufficient volume.

For the material, I will use **fiberglass**, as it is affordable, lightweight, and offers good structural integrity. The thickness will be set at **0.01m**.

### Nose Cone Design

The nose cone has a significant influence on aerodynamics. I will choose a **conical nose cone** with a length of 0.3m, which offers a favorable drag profile for the expected apogee. I will use the same fiberglass material for the nose cone.

### Fin Design

Aero stability is critical; hence I will choose **3 fins** which provide adequate directional stability. 

- **Root Chord**: 0.15m
- **Tip Chord**: 0.075m
- **Span**: 0.25m 
- **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees (aligned with the rocket's body)
- Fins will also be made from **fiberglass** with a thickness of **0.005m**.

### Parachute Specifications

The design requires a parachute for a safe landing. I will choose a main parachute and a drogue parachute, each with a coefficient of drag area (CD_s) of **0.5 mÂ²**, which is a balance between deployment timing and descent speed.

### Launch Rail Configuration

The launch rail will be **2m long** to provide adequate support during the initial launch phase. The inclination will be **90 degrees** for a vertical launch, ensuring it goes straight up against wind conditions.

### Payload

I will assume a lightweight payload of **0.2kg** positioned at **0.75m** relative to the center of the rocket, ensuring enough stability without significantly affecting the weight distribution.

### Final Design Configuration

Here's how all of these considerations come together in the final design in dictionary format:

### Summary of Design Reasoning:
- **Motor**: Provides the necessary thrust and has a good total impulse for reaching the apogee.
- **Body**: The dimensions optimize aerodynamics while ensuring structural integrity with a suitable material.
- **Nose Cone**: Selected for optimal aerodynamics for high altitude.
- **Fins**: Designed for stability with a sufficient number to reduce drag and keep the rocket stable during ascent.
- **Parachutes**: Configured for a safe landing to adhere to weight limits for descent speed.
- **Launch Configuration**: Ensures stable initial trajectory.

This design balances performance, cost, and structural integrity based on the requirements provided.
