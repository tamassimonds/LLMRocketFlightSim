# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

Before answering you should provide your full reasoning for the design choices you made thinking like a rocket scientist. Run sample calulations, make approximations etc to find best design



=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
Below is a step-by-step reasoning of my design process, followed by the final rocket configuration in the requested Python dictionary format.

──────────────────────────────────
1. Target Apogee and Motor Choice
──────────────────────────────────
• The rocket must reach about 3048 meters (10,000 ft).  
• From the list of motors, I considered the CesaroniK160 and AeroTechK700W. Both have total impulse in the 1500–2250 Ns range, which is generally suitable for a mid-sized high-power rocket reaching a few thousand meters in altitude.  
• The K160 has a total impulse of about 1521.7 Ns, an average thrust of about 190 N, and a relatively long burn time of 9.7 seconds. This longer burn reduces peak acceleration and helps keep the rocket from overshooting too high when combined with a mid-weight rocket design. Also, it should keep cost lower than larger motors.  

──────────────────────────────────
2. Mass and Geometry Estimates
──────────────────────────────────
• To hit about 3 km, I estimated a total mass (empty rocket + motor + payload) roughly between 3 kg and 5 kg.  
• The K160 motor radius is 54 mm (0.054 m). Therefore, the rocket body radius must be larger than 0.054 m; I chose 0.06 m so there’s enough clearance.  
• A body length of 1.5 m is a common size for mid-power/high-power rockets aiming for a few kilometers of altitude.  

──────────────────────────────────
3. Material Selection
──────────────────────────────────
• Fiberglass is a common choice for a mid-power rocket body because it provides a decent strength-to-weight ratio and is relatively cost-effective compared to carbon fiber.  
• For fins, plywood or balsa wood is often used in many hobby rockets to lower costs. I chose plywood for moderate strength and low cost.  
• Nose cone also fiberglass for simplicity and to ensure consistent material properties, though balsa or plastic are often used in smaller rockets.  

──────────────────────────────────
4. Nose Cone and Fin Design
──────────────────────────────────
• Nose Cone: “ogive” shape, about 0.25 m in length is typical for a rocket of ~1.5 m body length.  
• Fins: Four fins, each with a moderate root chord and tip chord. A small cant angle (0° to 2°) or so can help with spin for stability, but I will keep it 0.5° to keep aerodynamic efficiency. Root chord of 0.15 m, tip chord of 0.06 m, and a 0.2 m span are typical proportions for a 6 cm radius body.  

──────────────────────────────────
5. Tail Cone
──────────────────────────────────
• The top radius (matching the rocket’s main body) is 0.06 m, and to avoid a DRC error, we make the bottom radius slightly bigger at 0.065 m. A 0.2 m length is enough to taper gently and maintain stable airflow behind the rocket.  

──────────────────────────────────
6. Parachutes and Safe Landing
──────────────────────────────────
• We need a main parachute large enough to land under 5 m/s. While we don’t have an exact simulation in this text-based environment, a CD·S of around 0.75 for the main is a ballpark figure for a mid-power rocket returning slowly. A smaller drogue (CD·S ~ 0.1) is often used to control descent from high altitude until main deployment, but because the triggers are both set to “apogee” in this example, effectively only one might be used or the drogue is a small stabilizer.  
• These values are representative and commonly used in simulation software to yield a safe landing speed.  

──────────────────────────────────
7. Launch Rail Configuration
──────────────────────────────────
• A typical launch rail length of around 2 m is chosen to ensure stable liftoff.  
• Launch inclination is 90° (vertical). Despite a 5 m/s wind from the east, a near-vertical launch is usually assumed unless we specifically want a significant downrange travel. We want to minimize horizontal distance to stay near the launch site.  
• Heading at 0° means we are oriented “north” or simply consistent with a baseline (straight up in many simulations).  

──────────────────────────────────
8. Payload
──────────────────────────────────
• A small payload of 0.5 kg placed near the rocket’s center of gravity (mid-body). I chose position=0.75 m from the bottom if the rocket is 1.5 m in total body length, but because the simulation references rocket center, we can just put 0.3 or 0.4. In this configuration, position=0.4 means it is 0.4 m from the rocket’s center.  

These choices together should plausibly reach around 3 km, keep cost moderate (not using an enormous motor or exotic materials), and return safely under parachute.

--- ATTEMPT 2 ---
Design:
Below is a step-by-step rationale for how I arrived at the new design, followed by the final Python “config” dictionary. The goal is to get closer to the target apogee (3048 m) than the previous attempt while keeping cost reasonably low and ensuring safe recovery.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Observing Previous Undershoot and Choosing a Larger Motor
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The previous rocket, using the CesaroniK160 (≈1522 Ns total impulse), only reached about 641 m, far below the 3048 m target.  
• Therefore, a bigger motor is needed. The Pro75M1670 has about 6023.6 Ns of total impulse (roughly four times the K160), which is a good candidate to more than triple (hopefully quadruple) apogee.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) Accommodating the Motor Dimensions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The Pro75M1670 motor has a 75 mm radius (0.075 m). Our rocket body must have a slightly larger radius, so I chose 0.08 m.  
• The motor’s length is about 0.757 m, so the rocket body should be at least a meter or more to properly house it and maintain stable aerodynamic shape.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Rocket Body and Material Selections
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• A fiberglass airframe is still a reasonable compromise between cost, strength, and weight.  
• To keep mass under control so we can reach near 3 km (instead of going much higher or lower), I chose a 2.0 m overall body length—enough to ensure stable flight but not overly large.  
• Wall thickness of 0.003 m (3 mm) for structural integrity without too much mass penalty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) Nose Cone
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• A 0.4 m ogive nose cone is chosen to reduce drag and help achieve a higher apogee. Material remains fiberglass for consistency.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) Fins
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Four fins, each with a moderately sized root chord and tip chord to ensure good stability.  
• Root chord = 0.20 m, tip chord = 0.08 m, and a 0.25 m span help provide sufficient fin area.  
• A small cant angle (1 degree) can help with slight spin for stability.  
• Plywood fins (0.003 m thick) keep costs lower than carbon fiber, while still providing decent strength.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) Tail Cone
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Length = 0.2 m, top_radius = 0.08 m (matching the main body), bottom_radius = 0.07 m (narrowing slightly for improved aerodynamics).  
• Made of fiberglass.  
• Ensures we satisfy the “top and bottom radius cannot be the same” requirement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7) Parachutes and Safe Landing
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Main parachute sized at cd_s = 1.0 to slow descent suitably below about 5 m/s for a rocket in the 4–5 kg range.  
• A small drogue at cd_s = 0.1 is triggered at apogee to help stable initial descent.  
• Both have identical triggers here (apogee), but effectively the main is the larger canopy for final slowdown.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8) Launch Rail and Payload
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• A 2.0 m rail length ensures stable launch guidance.  
• Inclination = 90° (straight up) to minimize horizontal drift despite the 5 m/s crosswind.  
• A small 0.5 kg payload placed at position 0.4 m from the rocket center (for stable CG location).

With these choices, we expect a significantly higher apogee closer to 3048 m, and the cost should still be well below the 1000 limit, albeit higher than the previous K160 design.
