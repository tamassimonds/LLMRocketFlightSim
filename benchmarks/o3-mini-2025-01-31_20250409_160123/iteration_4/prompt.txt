# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
Below is my reasoning along with the final configuration.

──────────────────────────────
Design Reasoning:

1. Motor Choice:
   • We need enough impulse to roughly reach 3048 m (10,000 ft) and yet keep the mass and cost moderate. Using a moderate-performance motor is desirable. The Pro75M1670 provides about 6023.6 Ns of total impulse at a moderate mass (1.815 kg) and with a burn time of about 3.9 seconds. This makes it a good candidate for achieving our target while not overdesigning (and overcosting) the vehicle.
   • Note that the motor’s radius is 75 mm (0.075 m), so the body must use a radius larger than that.

2. Rocket Body:
   • I choose a body radius of 0.1 m. This leaves clearance over the motor while keeping the vehicle streamlined.
   • A length of 2.0 m is chosen to accommodate the motor, structural bulk, and recovery systems (airframe plus nose cone).
   • The material selected is “aluminum” because it is widely available, reasonably strong, and cost‐effective.
   • A wall thickness of 0.005 m is assumed to provide sufficient strength without excess weight.

3. Aerodynamics:
   Nose Cone:
     • An “ogive” profile is chosen for its favorable aerodynamic properties in reducing drag during ascent.
     • A nose cone length of 0.3 m is selected.
     • “composite” material is chosen to keep it light and efficient.
     
   Fins:
     • Four fins are chosen for multi-axis stability.
     • Fin dimensions are selected as follows: a root chord of 0.15 m and a tip chord of 0.075 m (tapered design) to reduce drag and weight.
     • A span (fins’ outboard length) of 0.3 m is adequate.
     • A slight cant angle (0.5°) is used to help with roll stability.
     • “carbon_fiber” is picked for the fins to ensure low weight and high stiffness.
     • A thickness of 0.005 m provides sufficient rigidity.
     
   Tail:
     • The tail section is used to attach and support aerodynamic surfaces. Since the design rule requires the top and bottom radii not to be equal (to avoid errors), I choose a top_radius of 0.04 m and a bottom_radius of 0.05 m.
     • A tail “length” of 0.2 m is selected.
     • “carbon_fiber” is used for its strength and consistency with the fins.
   
4. Parachute Specifications:
   • Both main and drogue parachutes are included.
   • The main chute is given a cd_s value (area * drag coefficient) of 0.25 to ensure a slow, safe descent.
   • The drogue chute uses a cd_s of 0.2.
   • Both are triggered at apogee, sampled at 105 Hz, with a lag of 1.5 s and noise parameters (0, 8.3, 0.5) as specified.
     
5. Launch Rail and Orientation:
   • A rail length of 1.2 m is selected for stability during the initial powered phase.
   • The rail is set at 90° to ensure a vertical launch.
   • The heading is kept at 0°; although there is a 5 m/s wind from the east, aiming vertically helps mitigate lateral displacement.
     
6. Payload:
   • A payload mass of 0.5 kg (a modest point mass) is assumed.
   • Its position is set near mid‐length (0.6 m from the rocket’s center) to maintain the vehicle’s balance.

--- ATTEMPT 2 ---
Design:
Below is my full reasoning followed by a finalized configuration that you can drop into the simulation.

──────────────────────────────
Design Reasoning:

We want to hit an apogee of 3048.0 m while keeping costs low, avoiding structural failures, and limiting horizontal drift despite a 5 m/s easterly wind. In previous attempts the Pro75M1670 motor (with about 6023.6 Ns of total impulse) powered a rocket whose “blow‐up” geometry (a relatively large body diameter) produced excessive aerodynamic drag. That design reached only about 1320 m of altitude. To improve our performance without immediately “jumping” to a much more expensive (and heavy) high‐impulse motor, we instead decided to fine–tune our geometry while still using the moderate–impulse Pro75M1670. In doing so we can enjoy lower cost and lower mass benefits while reducing drag losses. 

Key ideas and sample calculations:

1. Motor Selection:
  • We choose Pro75M1670. Its impulse is moderate (6023.6 Ns) and its mass of 1.815 kg keeps the cost and overall mass low.
  • Its listed motor radius is 75 mm (0.075 m). That forces us to have a rocket body with an inner diameter larger than that.
  
2. Rocket Body:
  • In the previous attempt the body radius was 0.1 m—but that produced a relatively large drag cross–section. By tightening the body we can reduce drag considerably.
  • However the body still must be larger than the motor. We choose 0.08 m for the body radius. (Note: 0.08 m > 0.075 m so the clearance is minimal but acceptable for simulation purposes.) 
  • We lengthen the body to 2.5 m so that the aerodynamic “loading” is spread over a longer vehicle and internal components (like the payload, motor, and parachute attachment) can be accommodated.
  • The wall thickness is held at 0.005 m and we use “aluminum” because it is strong yet cost–effective.
  
3. Aerodynamics:
  Nose Cone:
   • We choose a “von karman” profile because it is known for excellent drag performance.
   • A length of 0.4 m provides a smoothly tapered tip.
   • We use “composite” to keep the nose cone light.
  
  Fins:
   • Four fins are retained for balanced roll stability.
   • Because the overall body is now slimmer, we reduce the fin chord lengths. The root chord is 0.1 m and the tip chord 0.05 m (providing a clean taper).
   • We select a modest fin span of 0.1 m as even small fins can provide adequate aerodynamic stability on a streamlined craft.
   • A modest cant angle of 1.0° is added to assist roll stability without inducing excessive side–force.
   • “carbon_fiber” is chosen for its high stiffness-to-weight ratio and resistance to breakage, with a thickness of 0.003 m.
  
  Tail:
   • The tail is used not only for mounting but also has aerodynamic importance. To satisfy the design check the top and bottom radii must not be equal—so we select 0.02 m (top) and 0.03 m (bottom).
   • A tail length of 0.3 m is sufficient.
   • We also use “carbon_fiber” for consistency and strength.
  
4. Parachutes:
  • A safe landing (impact velocity below 5 m/s) is essential. We choose a slightly larger main chute with cd_s = 0.3, while the drogue uses cd_s = 0.2.
  • Both parachutes are triggered at apogee and have the standard sampling rate, lag, and noise.
  
5. Launch Rail Configuration:
  • A rail length of 2.0 m is adopted. A longer rail helps with guiding the rocket during the powered flight phase and minimizes horizontal perturbations.
  • The rail is set to exactly 90° (vertical) so that any horizontal wind (5 m/s from the east) is countered by launching straight up.
  
6. Payload:
  • A modest payload mass of 0.5 kg is used.
  • Placing the payload near the center of a 2.5 m body (at 1.25 m from the nose) helps optimize the center of mass for stability.

By concentrating on improved aerodynamic efficiency (especially by reducing the body diameter and refining the nose cone and fins) we expect drag losses to be minimized. This should allow the Pro75M1670 motor to deliver more of its impulse to reaching near the 3048 m target apogee while keeping the cost and structural risks low.

Design:
Below is my full reasoning and sample “back‐of–the–envelope” calculations followed by a final Python configuration.

──────────────────────────────
Design Reasoning:

1. Motor Selection:
   • Our previous attempts using the moderate–impulse Pro75M1670 did not deliver nearly enough energy to reach an apogee of 3048 m. In order to hit this target, we need considerably more total impulse.
   • I chose the "CesaroniO5800" motor. Its listed total impulse is about 30382.7 Ns compared to roughly 6000 Ns for Pro75M1670. Although its dry mass is higher (12.418 kg) and its radius is 150 mm (0.15 m), its performance makes it a prime candidate for a high–altitude flight.
   
2. Rocket Body:
   • Because the motor radius is 0.15 m, the inner diameter of our body must be larger. I set the body radius to 0.18 m. This provides a minimal but acceptable clearance while keeping the vehicle as slender as possible (thus limiting aerodynamic drag).
   • I increased the body length to 4.0 m to allow for improved aerodynamic efficiency (a higher fineness ratio helps reduce drag) and to properly accommodate the motor, recovery system, and payload.
   • Material is chosen as “aluminum” because it is both strong and cost–effective; and a wall thickness of 0.005 m is used to keep mass low.

3. Aerodynamics:
   Nose Cone:
     • I selected an “ogive” nose cone due to its favorable drag characteristics during high–speed flight.
     • I chose a length of 0.5 m; this produces a gentle taper that complements the long, slender body and minimizes shock waves at supersonic speeds.
     • Material is “composite” so that it remains light while offering sufficient strength.
   
   Fins:
     • Four fins ensure static stability. I chose a root chord of 0.2 m and tip chord of 0.1 m to create an effective taper and to limit overall weight and drag.
     • A fin span of 0.3 m is chosen; this is large enough for aerodynamic leverage without adding excessive drag.
     • A slight cant angle of 0.5° is added to ensure the rocket has a mild rolling moment that improves stability.
     • “carbon_fiber” is used for the fins because it is very stiff and minimizes the risk of flex or breakage. A thickness of 0.005 m was selected to provide rigidity with minimal added mass.
   
   Tail:
     • The tail section provides additional aerodynamic stability as well as an attachment point for the recovery system. To comply with the design check (top and bottom radii must differ), I set the top radius to 0.06 m and the bottom radius to 0.07 m.
     • A tail length of 0.3 m is used.
     • The tail material is also “carbon_fiber” for consistency and structural strength.

4. Parachute Specifications:
   • Reaching a target apogee of 3048 m and then achieving a safe, low–velocity landing (impact speeds less than 5 m/s) is critical.
   • I have chosen a larger main parachute (cd_s = 0.35) to provide a slower descent.
   • The drogue parachute remains slightly smaller with cd_s = 0.2.
   • Both are triggered at apogee with a sampling_rate of 105, lag of 1.5, and noise parameters (0, 8.3, 0.5).

5. Launch Rail Configuration:
   • A rail length of 3.0 m is selected to provide a longer guidance path for robust initial acceleration. This helps mitigate the effects of a 5 m/s easterly wind.
   • The rail inclination is set to 90° for a vertical launch.
   • The heading is set to 0° (i.e. “straight up” in our simulation’s definition) so that any lateral drifting due to crosswind is minimized.

6. Payload:
   • A modest payload mass of 0.5 kg is assumed.
   • For optimal balance in a 4.0 m long rocket body, the payload is placed at 2.0 m from the nose (i.e. around the vehicle’s center of mass).

──────────────────────────────
With these choices, the design aims to provide the high impulse needed to attain 3048 m while still controlling cost (by using cost–effective materials where possible) and ensuring a safe, low–drift landing.
