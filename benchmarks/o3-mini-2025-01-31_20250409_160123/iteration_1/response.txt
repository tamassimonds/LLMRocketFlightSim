Below is my reasoning along with the final configuration.

──────────────────────────────
Design Reasoning:

1. Motor Choice:
   • We need enough impulse to roughly reach 3048 m (10,000 ft) and yet keep the mass and cost moderate. Using a moderate-performance motor is desirable. The Pro75M1670 provides about 6023.6 Ns of total impulse at a moderate mass (1.815 kg) and with a burn time of about 3.9 seconds. This makes it a good candidate for achieving our target while not overdesigning (and overcosting) the vehicle.
   • Note that the motor’s radius is 75 mm (0.075 m), so the body must use a radius larger than that.

2. Rocket Body:
   • I choose a body radius of 0.1 m. This leaves clearance over the motor while keeping the vehicle streamlined.
   • A length of 2.0 m is chosen to accommodate the motor, structural bulk, and recovery systems (airframe plus nose cone).
   • The material selected is “aluminum” because it is widely available, reasonably strong, and cost‐effective.
   • A wall thickness of 0.005 m is assumed to provide sufficient strength without excess weight.

3. Aerodynamics:
   Nose Cone:
     • An “ogive” profile is chosen for its favorable aerodynamic properties in reducing drag during ascent.
     • A nose cone length of 0.3 m is selected.
     • “composite” material is chosen to keep it light and efficient.
     
   Fins:
     • Four fins are chosen for multi-axis stability.
     • Fin dimensions are selected as follows: a root chord of 0.15 m and a tip chord of 0.075 m (tapered design) to reduce drag and weight.
     • A span (fins’ outboard length) of 0.3 m is adequate.
     • A slight cant angle (0.5°) is used to help with roll stability.
     • “carbon_fiber” is picked for the fins to ensure low weight and high stiffness.
     • A thickness of 0.005 m provides sufficient rigidity.
     
   Tail:
     • The tail section is used to attach and support aerodynamic surfaces. Since the design rule requires the top and bottom radii not to be equal (to avoid errors), I choose a top_radius of 0.04 m and a bottom_radius of 0.05 m.
     • A tail “length” of 0.2 m is selected.
     • “carbon_fiber” is used for its strength and consistency with the fins.
   
4. Parachute Specifications:
   • Both main and drogue parachutes are included.
   • The main chute is given a cd_s value (area * drag coefficient) of 0.25 to ensure a slow, safe descent.
   • The drogue chute uses a cd_s of 0.2.
   • Both are triggered at apogee, sampled at 105 Hz, with a lag of 1.5 s and noise parameters (0, 8.3, 0.5) as specified.
     
5. Launch Rail and Orientation:
   • A rail length of 1.2 m is selected for stability during the initial powered phase.
   • The rail is set at 90° to ensure a vertical launch.
   • The heading is kept at 0°; although there is a 5 m/s wind from the east, aiming vertically helps mitigate lateral displacement.
     
6. Payload:
   • A payload mass of 0.5 kg (a modest point mass) is assumed.
   • Its position is set near mid‐length (0.6 m from the rocket’s center) to maintain the vehicle’s balance.
