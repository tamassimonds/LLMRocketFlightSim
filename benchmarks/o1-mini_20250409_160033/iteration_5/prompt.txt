# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

**Rocket Design Reasoning**

Designing a rocket to achieve a specific apogee of 3,048 meters (10,000 feet) involves careful consideration of various factors, including propulsion, structural integrity, aerodynamics, payload, and environmental conditions. Below is a detailed reasoning of the design choices made to meet the specified requirements and optimize the scoring criteria.

---

### 1. **Motor Selection**

**Available Motors:**
- **Pro75M1670**: Thrust: 2200 N, Burn Time: 3.9 s, Total Impulse: 6023.6 Ns, Dry Mass: 1.815 kg
- **CesaroniO5800**: Thrust: 6395.5 N, Burn Time: 5.2 s, Total Impulse: 30382.7 Ns, Dry Mass: 12.418 kg
- *(Other motors have lower thrust and are less suitable for the target apogee)*

**Selection:** **CesaroniO5800**

**Rationale:**
- **Higher Thrust:** To achieve the desired apogee, sufficient thrust is crucial. The CesaroniO5800 offers a significantly higher thrust (6395.5 N) compared to the Pro75M1670.
- **Total Impulse:** A higher total impulse ensures adequate propulsion over the burn time to reach the target altitude.
- **Dry Mass Consideration:** While the CesaroniO5800 has a higher dry mass, the increased thrust compensates by providing the necessary energy to overcome gravity and atmospheric drag.

*Although the Pro75M1670 is lighter and cheaper, its lower thrust may not suffice to reach the target apogee, especially under wind conditions. Therefore, prioritizing thrust over mass and cost leads to the selection of the CesaroniO5800.*

---

### 2. **Rocket Body Design**

- **Radius:** Must exceed the motor's radius (0.15 m). **Selected Radius:** 0.2 m
- **Length:** Must accommodate the motor and payload while maintaining structural integrity. **Selected Length:** 1.2 m
- **Material:** Needs to balance strength, weight, and cost. **Selected Material:** Fiberglass
- **Thickness:** Ensures structural strength without adding unnecessary weight. **Selected Thickness:** 0.01 m

*Fiberglass offers a good balance between strength and weight, ensuring the rocket remains lightweight while capable of withstanding aerodynamic stresses.*

---

### 3. **Aerodynamics**

#### a. **Nose Cone**
- **Kind:** **Ogive** (common for high-speed stability)
- **Length:** 0.3 m
- **Material:** Composite (lightweight and strong)

*An ogive nose cone minimizes aerodynamic drag, contributing to efficient ascent.*

#### b. **Fins**
- **Number:** 4 (ensures stability)
- **Root Chord:** 0.15 m
- **Tip Chord:** 0.075 m (achieves a tapered fin for better airflow)
- **Span:** 0.3 m
- **Cant Angle:** 0 degrees (no cant to simplify design and maintain symmetry)
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber (high strength-to-weight ratio)
- **Thickness:** 0.005 m

*Carbon fiber fins provide robust stability against wind conditions without significantly increasing weight.*

#### c. **Tail**
- **Length:** 1.2 m
- **Top Radius:** 0.04 m
- **Bottom Radius:** 0.05 m (different from top radius to pass DRC)
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber

*A tapered tail with differing top and bottom radii prevents structural errors and maintains aerodynamic balance.*

---

### 4. **Parachutes**

- **Main Parachute:**
  - **CD_S:** 0.25
  - **Trigger:** Apogee
  - **Sampling Rate:** 105
  - **Lag:** 1.5
  - **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

- **Drogue Parachute:**
  - **CD_S:** 0.2
  - **Trigger:** Apogee
  - **Sampling Rate:** 105
  - **Lag:** 1.5
  - **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

*Dual parachute system ensures a safe and controlled descent, minimizing impact velocity and potential landing damage.*

---

### 5. **Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length:** 1.2 m
- **Inclination:** 90 degrees (vertical launch to optimize altitude)
- **Heading:** 0 degrees (straight up to minimize horizontal displacement)

*Vertical launch reduces horizontal drift caused by wind, keeping the landing site closer to the launch site.*

---

### 6. **Payload**

- **Mass:** 0.5 kg (lightweight to reduce overall rocket mass)
- **Position:** 0.6 m relative to rocket center (optimized for center of mass)

*A lightweight payload ensures more mass can be allocated to structural and propulsion components, enhancing performance.*

---

### 7. **Wind Conditions Consideration**

- **Wind Speed:** 5 m/s from the East
- **Design Mitigation:** 
  - **Fins and Tail:** Robust fins and a tapered tail provide stability against lateral wind forces.
  - **Launch Heading:** Launching vertically with a heading of 0 degrees minimizes horizontal displacement due to wind.

*These measures ensure the rocket maintains its intended trajectory and minimizes horizontal drift, optimizing the scoring criteria related to horizontal distance from the launch site.*

# Rocket Design Task - Improved Design

## Design Reasoning

Designing a rocket to achieve a **target apogee** of **3,048 meters** requires meticulous optimization of various components to balance performance, cost, and structural integrity. Building upon the insights from the previous attempt, the following design improvements aim to enhance apogee achievement, reduce costs, ensure safe landings, and minimize horizontal displacement.

### 1. **Motor Selection**

**Available Motors:**
- **Pro75M1670**: Thrust: 2200 N, Burn Time: 3.9 s, Total Impulse: 6,023.6 Ns, Dry Mass: 1.815 kg
- **CesaroniM1670**: Thrust: 2200 N, Burn Time: 3.6 s, Total Impulse: 6,023.6 Ns, Dry Mass: 3.101 kg
- **CesaroniO3700**: Thrust: 4,030.3 N, Burn Time: 8.2 s, Total Impulse: 29,930.2 Ns, Dry Mass: 14.194 kg
- **CesaroniO5800**: Thrust: 6,395.5 N, Burn Time: 5.2 s, Total Impulse: 30,382.7 Ns, Dry Mass: 12.418 kg
- **Other Motors**: Lower thrust and impulse, less suitable for target apogee.

**Selection:** **Pro75M1670**

**Rationale:**
- **Adequate Thrust and Impulse:** While the CesaroniO5800 provides higher thrust, the Pro75M1670's total impulse of 6,023.6 Ns is sufficient when combined with a lightweight rocket design.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** The Pro75M1670 is expected to be significantly cheaper than the CesaroniO5800, reducing the overall cost.
- **Dry Mass Consideration:** Lower dry mass contributes to a higher thrust-to-weight ratio, enhancing apogee potential.

**Trade-Offs:**
- **Multiple Motors:** To achieve the desired total impulse, using multiple Pro75M1670 motors could be considered. However, this adds complexity and potential points of failure.
- **Single Motor Simplicity:** Opting for a single motor simplifies design and reduces potential structural issues.

**Final Decision:** Using a single **Pro75M1670** motor strikes a balance between sufficient propulsion and cost-effectiveness, provided the rocket's structural design compensates for the lower total impulse.

### 2. **Rocket Body Design**

- **Radius:** Must exceed the motor's radius (0.075 m). **Selected Radius:** 0.09 m
- **Length:** Optimized to balance volume and weight. **Selected Length:** 1.0 m
- **Material:** **ABS_plastic** for its lightweight and cost advantages over fiberglass and carbon fiber.
- **Thickness:** Reduced to **0.005 m** to minimize mass while maintaining structural integrity.

**Rationale:**
- **Minimized Mass:** A smaller radius and thinner walls reduce overall weight, enhancing thrust efficiency.
- **Material Selection:** ABS_plastic offers sufficient strength for the rocket's structural needs at a lower cost.

### 3. **Aerodynamics**

#### a. **Nose Cone**
- **Kind:** **Von Kármán** (known for superior aerodynamic properties)
- **Length:** 0.25 m
- **Material:** **ABS_plastic**

**Rationale:**
A Von Kármán nose cone minimizes aerodynamic drag, facilitating smoother ascent and higher apogee attainment.

#### b. **Fins**
- **Number:** **3** (reducing drag while maintaining stability)
- **Root Chord:** **0.10 m**
- **Tip Chord:** **0.05 m**
- **Span:** **0.25 m**
- **Cant Angle:** **0 degrees** (simplifies design and reduces potential drag)
- **Material:** **Balsa_wood** (lightweight and cost-effective)
- **Thickness:** **0.003 m**

**Rationale:**
- **Reduced Number and Size:** Fewer and smaller fins decrease aerodynamic drag without compromising stability.
- **Material Choice:** Balsa wood offers adequate strength for fins while minimizing weight and cost.

#### c. **Tail**
- **Length:** **0.5 m**
- **Top Radius:** **0.03 m**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.04 m** (ensures different radii to pass DRC)
- **Material:** **Balsa_wood**

**Rationale:**
A compact tail with differing top and bottom radii maintains aerodynamic balance and structural integrity at a lower mass and cost.

### 4. **Parachutes**

- **Main Parachute:**
  - **CD_S:** **0.20**
  - **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate:** **105**
  - **Lag:** **1.5 s**
  - **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**
  
- **Drogue Parachute:**
  - **CD_S:** **0.15**
  - **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate:** **105**
  - **Lag:** **1.5 s**
  - **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**Rationale:**
Optimizing the parachute coefficients of drag (CD_S) ensures a controlled and safe descent, keeping impact velocity below the 5 m/s threshold while minimizing deployment complexity and cost.

### 5. **Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length:** **0.8 m** (shorter to reduce cost and ground footprint)
- **Inclination:** **90 degrees** (vertical launch to maximize apogee)
- **Heading:** **0 degrees** (aligned with wind direction to minimize horizontal drift)

**Rationale:**
A vertical launch maximizes altitude, and aligning the launch heading with wind direction mitigates horizontal displacement, ensuring the rocket lands closer to the launch site.

### 6. **Payload**

- **Mass:** **0.3 kg** (reducing payload mass to allow more thrust allocation)
- **Position:** **0.5 m** relative to rocket center (optimized for center of mass and stability)

**Rationale:**
Lowering the payload mass reduces the overall rocket weight, enhancing thrust efficiency and apogee potential. Proper positioning ensures stability during flight.

### 7. **Wind Conditions Consideration**

- **Wind Speed:** **5 m/s from East**
- **Design Mitigation:**
  - **Fin and Tail Design:** Lightweight and strategically placed fins and tails stabilize the rocket against lateral wind forces.
  - **Launch Heading Alignment:** Aligning the launch heading with wind direction minimizes horizontal drift.

**Rationale:**
These measures collectively enhance flight stability and reduce unwanted horizontal displacement, adhering to the scoring criteria.

### 8. **Cost Optimization**

**Material Choices:**
- **ABS_plastic and Balsa_wood** are selected for their lower costs compared to fiberglass and carbon fiber without significantly compromising structural integrity.

**Component Reduction:**
- **Fewer and Smaller Fins:** Reduces material cost and aerodynamic drag.
- **Thinner Body Walls:** Minimizes material usage and overall cost.

**Motor Selection:**
- Opting for the **Pro75M1670** reduces propulsion costs while maintaining sufficient thrust.

**Rationale:**
Strategic material and component selections significantly reduce the total cost, enhancing the cost reward in the scoring function.
