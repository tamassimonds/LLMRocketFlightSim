---

### 10. **Sample Calculations and Approximations**

**a. Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR):**

Ensures the rocket can overcome gravity and accelerate upward.

\[
TWR = \frac{\text{Total Thrust}}{\text{Total Weight}} = \frac{6395.5\, \text{N}}{(12.418\, \text{kg} + 0.4\, \text{kg}) \times 9.81\, \text{m/s}^2} \approx \frac{6395.5}{124.56} \approx 51.28
\]

A TWR significantly greater than 1 ensures the rocket can accelerate upward effectively.

**b. Drag Force Estimation:**

Minimizing drag is essential for reaching the target apogee.

\[
F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A
\]

Where:
- \(\rho\) = Air density ≈ 1.225 kg/m³
- \(v\) = Velocity (varies during ascent)
- \(C_d\) = Drag coefficient (optimized via aerodynamics)
- \(A\) = Cross-sectional area = \(\pi r^2\)

**Sample at 100 m/s:**

\[
A = \pi (0.18)^2 \approx 0.1018\, \text{m}^2
\]
\[
F_d = 0.5 \times 1.225 \times (100)^2 \times C_d \times 0.1018
\]

Assuming \(C_d = 0.5\):

\[
F_d = 0.5 \times 1.225 \times 10,000 \times 0.5 \times 0.1018 \approx 312.3125\, \text{N}
\]

**Impact on Performance:**

Higher thrust counters drag effectively, ensuring the rocket maintains velocity to reach apogee.

**c. Apogee Calculation (Simplified):**

Using the rocket equation and considering gravity losses, a detailed simulation is preferred. However, a rough estimation can be made using:

\[
\text{Apogee} \approx \frac{I}{m} \times V_{e} - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

Where:
- \(I\) = Total impulse = 30,382.7 Ns
- \(m\) = Total mass = 12.818 kg
- \(V_{e}\) = Effective exhaust velocity = Isp × g = 222 × 9.81 ≈ 2177 m/s
- \(g\) = 9.81 m/s²
- \(t\) = Burn time = 5.2 s

\[
\text{Apogee} \approx \frac{30,382.7}{12.818} \times 2177 - \frac{1}{2} \times 9.81 \times (5.2)^2
\]
\[
\approx 2370 \times 2177 - 132.67 \approx 5,164,490 - 132.67 \approx 5,164,357\, \text{meters}
\]

**Note:** This simplistic calculation vastly overestimates apogee due to neglecting atmospheric drag and realistic velocity profiles. Actual simulations will provide more accurate results.
