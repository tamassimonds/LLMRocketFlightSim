# Rocket Design Task - Improved Design

## Design Reasoning

Designing a rocket to achieve a **target apogee** of **3,048 meters** requires meticulous optimization of various components to balance performance, cost, and structural integrity. Building upon the insights from the previous attempt, the following design improvements aim to enhance apogee achievement, reduce costs, ensure safe landings, and minimize horizontal displacement.

### 1. **Motor Selection**

**Available Motors:**
- **Pro75M1670**: Thrust: 2200 N, Burn Time: 3.9 s, Total Impulse: 6,023.6 Ns, Dry Mass: 1.815 kg
- **CesaroniM1670**: Thrust: 2200 N, Burn Time: 3.6 s, Total Impulse: 6,023.6 Ns, Dry Mass: 3.101 kg
- **CesaroniO3700**: Thrust: 4,030.3 N, Burn Time: 8.2 s, Total Impulse: 29,930.2 Ns, Dry Mass: 14.194 kg
- **CesaroniO5800**: Thrust: 6,395.5 N, Burn Time: 5.2 s, Total Impulse: 30,382.7 Ns, Dry Mass: 12.418 kg
- **Other Motors**: Lower thrust and impulse, less suitable for target apogee.

**Selection:** **Pro75M1670**

**Rationale:**
- **Adequate Thrust and Impulse:** While the CesaroniO5800 provides higher thrust, the Pro75M1670's total impulse of 6,023.6 Ns is sufficient when combined with a lightweight rocket design.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** The Pro75M1670 is expected to be significantly cheaper than the CesaroniO5800, reducing the overall cost.
- **Dry Mass Consideration:** Lower dry mass contributes to a higher thrust-to-weight ratio, enhancing apogee potential.

**Trade-Offs:**
- **Multiple Motors:** To achieve the desired total impulse, using multiple Pro75M1670 motors could be considered. However, this adds complexity and potential points of failure.
- **Single Motor Simplicity:** Opting for a single motor simplifies design and reduces potential structural issues.

**Final Decision:** Using a single **Pro75M1670** motor strikes a balance between sufficient propulsion and cost-effectiveness, provided the rocket's structural design compensates for the lower total impulse.

### 2. **Rocket Body Design**

- **Radius:** Must exceed the motor's radius (0.075 m). **Selected Radius:** 0.09 m
- **Length:** Optimized to balance volume and weight. **Selected Length:** 1.0 m
- **Material:** **ABS_plastic** for its lightweight and cost advantages over fiberglass and carbon fiber.
- **Thickness:** Reduced to **0.005 m** to minimize mass while maintaining structural integrity.

**Rationale:**
- **Minimized Mass:** A smaller radius and thinner walls reduce overall weight, enhancing thrust efficiency.
- **Material Selection:** ABS_plastic offers sufficient strength for the rocket's structural needs at a lower cost.

### 3. **Aerodynamics**

#### a. **Nose Cone**
- **Kind:** **Von K치rm치n** (known for superior aerodynamic properties)
- **Length:** 0.25 m
- **Material:** **ABS_plastic**

**Rationale:**
A Von K치rm치n nose cone minimizes aerodynamic drag, facilitating smoother ascent and higher apogee attainment.

#### b. **Fins**
- **Number:** **3** (reducing drag while maintaining stability)
- **Root Chord:** **0.10 m**
- **Tip Chord:** **0.05 m**
- **Span:** **0.25 m**
- **Cant Angle:** **0 degrees** (simplifies design and reduces potential drag)
- **Material:** **Balsa_wood** (lightweight and cost-effective)
- **Thickness:** **0.003 m**

**Rationale:**
- **Reduced Number and Size:** Fewer and smaller fins decrease aerodynamic drag without compromising stability.
- **Material Choice:** Balsa wood offers adequate strength for fins while minimizing weight and cost.

#### c. **Tail**
- **Length:** **0.5 m**
- **Top Radius:** **0.03 m**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.04 m** (ensures different radii to pass DRC)
- **Material:** **Balsa_wood**

**Rationale:**
A compact tail with differing top and bottom radii maintains aerodynamic balance and structural integrity at a lower mass and cost.

### 4. **Parachutes**

- **Main Parachute:**
  - **CD_S:** **0.20**
  - **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate:** **105**
  - **Lag:** **1.5 s**
  - **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**
  
- **Drogue Parachute:**
  - **CD_S:** **0.15**
  - **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate:** **105**
  - **Lag:** **1.5 s**
  - **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**Rationale:**
Optimizing the parachute coefficients of drag (CD_S) ensures a controlled and safe descent, keeping impact velocity below the 5 m/s threshold while minimizing deployment complexity and cost.

### 5. **Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length:** **0.8 m** (shorter to reduce cost and ground footprint)
- **Inclination:** **90 degrees** (vertical launch to maximize apogee)
- **Heading:** **0 degrees** (aligned with wind direction to minimize horizontal drift)

**Rationale:**
A vertical launch maximizes altitude, and aligning the launch heading with wind direction mitigates horizontal displacement, ensuring the rocket lands closer to the launch site.

### 6. **Payload**

- **Mass:** **0.3 kg** (reducing payload mass to allow more thrust allocation)
- **Position:** **0.5 m** relative to rocket center (optimized for center of mass and stability)

**Rationale:**
Lowering the payload mass reduces the overall rocket weight, enhancing thrust efficiency and apogee potential. Proper positioning ensures stability during flight.

### 7. **Wind Conditions Consideration**

- **Wind Speed:** **5 m/s from East**
- **Design Mitigation:**
  - **Fin and Tail Design:** Lightweight and strategically placed fins and tails stabilize the rocket against lateral wind forces.
  - **Launch Heading Alignment:** Aligning the launch heading with wind direction minimizes horizontal drift.

**Rationale:**
These measures collectively enhance flight stability and reduce unwanted horizontal displacement, adhering to the scoring criteria.

### 8. **Cost Optimization**

**Material Choices:**
- **ABS_plastic and Balsa_wood** are selected for their lower costs compared to fiberglass and carbon fiber without significantly compromising structural integrity.

**Component Reduction:**
- **Fewer and Smaller Fins:** Reduces material cost and aerodynamic drag.
- **Thinner Body Walls:** Minimizes material usage and overall cost.

**Motor Selection:**
- Opting for the **Pro75M1670** reduces propulsion costs while maintaining sufficient thrust.

**Rationale:**
Strategic material and component selections significantly reduce the total cost, enhancing the cost reward in the scoring function.
