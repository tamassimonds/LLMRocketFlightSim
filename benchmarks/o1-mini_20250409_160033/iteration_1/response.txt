**Rocket Design Reasoning**

Designing a rocket to achieve a specific apogee of 3,048 meters (10,000 feet) involves careful consideration of various factors, including propulsion, structural integrity, aerodynamics, payload, and environmental conditions. Below is a detailed reasoning of the design choices made to meet the specified requirements and optimize the scoring criteria.

### 1. **Motor Selection**

**Available Motors:**
- **Pro75M1670**: Thrust: 2200 N, Burn Time: 3.9 s, Total Impulse: 6023.6 Ns, Dry Mass: 1.815 kg
- **CesaroniO5800**: Thrust: 6395.5 N, Burn Time: 5.2 s, Total Impulse: 30382.7 Ns, Dry Mass: 12.418 kg
- *(Other motors have lower thrust and are less suitable for the target apogee)*

**Selection:** **CesaroniO5800**

**Rationale:**
- **Higher Thrust:** To achieve the desired apogee, sufficient thrust is crucial. The CesaroniO5800 offers a significantly higher thrust (6395.5 N) compared to the Pro75M1670.
- **Total Impulse:** A higher total impulse ensures adequate propulsion over the burn time to reach the target altitude.
- **Dry Mass Consideration:** While the CesaroniO5800 has a higher dry mass, the increased thrust compensates by providing the necessary energy to overcome gravity and atmospheric drag.

*Although the Pro75M1670 is lighter and cheaper, its lower thrust may not suffice to reach the target apogee, especially under wind conditions. Therefore, prioritizing thrust over mass and cost leads to the selection of the CesaroniO5800.*

### 2. **Rocket Body Design**

- **Radius:** Must exceed the motor's radius (0.15 m). **Selected Radius:** 0.2 m
- **Length:** Must accommodate the motor and payload while maintaining structural integrity. **Selected Length:** 1.2 m
- **Material:** Needs to balance strength, weight, and cost. **Selected Material:** Fiberglass
- **Thickness:** Ensures structural strength without adding unnecessary weight. **Selected Thickness:** 0.01 m

*Fiberglass offers a good balance between strength and weight, ensuring the rocket remains lightweight while capable of withstanding aerodynamic stresses.*

---

### 3. **Aerodynamics**

#### a. **Nose Cone**
- **Kind:** **Ogive** (common for high-speed stability)
- **Length:** 0.3 m
- **Material:** Composite (lightweight and strong)

*An ogive nose cone minimizes aerodynamic drag, contributing to efficient ascent.*

#### b. **Fins**
- **Number:** 4 (ensures stability)
- **Root Chord:** 0.15 m
- **Tip Chord:** 0.075 m (achieves a tapered fin for better airflow)
- **Span:** 0.3 m
- **Cant Angle:** 0 degrees (no cant to simplify design and maintain symmetry)
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber (high strength-to-weight ratio)
- **Thickness:** 0.005 m

*Carbon fiber fins provide robust stability against wind conditions without significantly increasing weight.*

#### c. **Tail**
- **Length:** 1.2 m
- **Top Radius:** 0.04 m
- **Bottom Radius:** 0.05 m (different from top radius to pass DRC)
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber

*A tapered tail with differing top and bottom radii prevents structural errors and maintains aerodynamic balance.*

### 4. **Parachutes**

- **Main Parachute:**
  - **CD_S:** 0.25
  - **Trigger:** Apogee
  - **Sampling Rate:** 105
  - **Lag:** 1.5
  - **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

- **Drogue Parachute:**
  - **CD_S:** 0.2
  - **Trigger:** Apogee
  - **Sampling Rate:** 105
  - **Lag:** 1.5
  - **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

*Dual parachute system ensures a safe and controlled descent, minimizing impact velocity and potential landing damage.*

---

### 5. **Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length:** 1.2 m
- **Inclination:** 90 degrees (vertical launch to optimize altitude)
- **Heading:** 0 degrees (straight up to minimize horizontal displacement)

*Vertical launch reduces horizontal drift caused by wind, keeping the landing site closer to the launch site.*

---

### 6. **Payload**

- **Mass:** 0.5 kg (lightweight to reduce overall rocket mass)
- **Position:** 0.6 m relative to rocket center (optimized for center of mass)

*A lightweight payload ensures more mass can be allocated to structural and propulsion components, enhancing performance.*

---

### 7. **Wind Conditions Consideration**

- **Wind Speed:** 5 m/s from the East
- **Design Mitigation:** 
  - **Fins and Tail:** Robust fins and a tapered tail provide stability against lateral wind forces.
  - **Launch Heading:** Launching vertically with a heading of 0 degrees minimizes horizontal displacement due to wind.

*These measures ensure the rocket maintains its intended trajectory and minimizes horizontal drift, optimizing the scoring criteria related to horizontal distance from the launch site.*
