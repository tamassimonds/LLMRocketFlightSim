# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing all seven previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns:

| Attempt | Motor | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Score |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Pro75M1670 | 2447.52 | 19.70% | PASSED | 619.70 | 74.92 |
| 3 | Pro75M1670 | 2280.61 | 25.18% | PASSED | 610.15 | 73.80 |
| 7 | Pro75M1670 | 2453.77 | 19.50% | PASSED | 602.65 | 73.59 |
| 4 | AeroTechK700W | 1819.67 | 40.30% | PASSED | 296.84 | 68.18 |
| 5 | AeroTechK700W | 2019.49 | 33.74% | FAILED | 211.36 | 61.92 |
| 6 | CesaroniO3700 | 534.97 | 82.45% | PASSED | 2359.35 | 30.78 |
| 2 | CesaroniK160 | 398.21 | 86.94% | FAILED | 242.67 | 29.89 |

Key insights:
1. The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently performed best, reaching ~80% of our target altitude
2. We need to increase altitude by ~20% from our best attempts
3. Attempts with the Pro75M1670 motor have all been structurally sound
4. We need to find the right balance between impulse, weight, and drag

## Motor Selection Analysis

Since the Pro75M1670 has consistently gotten us closest to our target, I'll continue with this motor but need to optimize further to increase altitude by approximately 20%.

Looking at the next step up in our motor options:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 |

The CesaroniO5800 has 5x the impulse but is 6.8x heavier and would likely cause significant overshoot. Let's optimize with the Pro75M1670.

## Altitude Optimization Strategy

To increase altitude from ~2450m to 3048m (25% increase) with the same motor:

1. **Weight Reduction**: The most critical factor for increasing altitude
   - Use the lightest possible materials that maintain structural integrity
   - Minimize dimensions while ensuring stability
   - Reduce payload mass to absolute minimum

2. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Use an optimized nose cone shape (elliptical or von Karman)
   - Minimize body diameter to just above motor diameter
   - Optimize fin design for minimal drag while maintaining stability

3. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Optimize launch angle to maximize vertical component of thrust while accounting for wind

## Detailed Design Calculations

For Pro75M1670:
- Motor radius: 75mm = 0.075m
- Minimum body radius: 0.077m (provides 2mm clearance)
- Target rocket mass without motor: ~1.0kg (using ultralight materials)
- Total mass with motor: ~2.8kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 1533.9N / (2.8kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 56 (excellent for quick rail exit)

}
```

This design represents the ultimate optimization of the Pro75M1670 configuration:

1. **Material Selection**: Carbon fiber throughout provides the best strength-to-weight ratio
2. **Minimized Dimensions**: Body radius is just 2mm larger than the motor radius
3. **Optimized Aerodynamics**: Elliptical nose cone and minimal fin size reduce drag
4. **Weight Reduction**: Minimized wall thickness, payload mass, and overall dimensions
5. **Launch Configuration**: Nearly vertical launch (89°) to maximize altitude while still accounting for wind

The design pushes the limits of weight reduction while maintaining structural integrity, which should provide the ~20% increase in altitude needed to reach our target of 3048m.
