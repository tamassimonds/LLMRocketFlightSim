# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing all previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns:

| Attempt | Motor | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Score |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Pro75M1670 | 2447.52 | 19.70% | PASSED | 619.70 | 74.92 |
| 2 | CesaroniK160 | 398.21 | 86.94% | FAILED | 242.67 | 29.89 |
| 3 | Pro75M1670 | 2280.61 | 25.18% | PASSED | 610.15 | 73.80 |
| 4 | AeroTechK700W | 1819.67 | 40.30% | PASSED | 296.84 | 68.18 |
| 5 | AeroTechK700W | 2019.49 | 33.74% | FAILED | 211.36 | 61.92 |
| 6 | CesaroniO3700 | 534.97 | 82.45% | PASSED | 2359.35 | 30.78 |

Key insights:
1. The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently performed best, reaching ~80% of our target altitude
2. Lightweight designs with AeroTechK700W are cost-effective but underpowered
3. The CesaroniO3700 was too heavy and expensive, resulting in poor performance
4. We need to find the right balance between impulse, weight, and structural integrity

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

Looking at our available motors again:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Burn Time (s) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 3.9 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 3.5 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 3.6 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 1.29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 8.2 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 5.2 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 9.7 |

Since the Pro75M1670 has consistently gotten us closest to our target, I'll stick with this motor but optimize the design to increase altitude by approximately 25%.

## Altitude Optimization Strategy

To increase altitude from ~2350m to 3048m (30% increase) with the same motor:

1. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Use lighter materials where possible
   - Optimize dimensions to minimize weight while maintaining structural integrity
   - Reduce payload mass to minimum

2. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Use an optimized nose cone shape (von Karman)
   - Minimize body diameter while accommodating the motor
   - Optimize fin design for minimal drag

3. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Optimize launch angle to balance wind compensation and vertical thrust

## Detailed Design Calculations

For Pro75M1670:
- Motor radius: 75mm = 0.075m
- Minimum body radius: 0.078m (provides 3mm clearance)
- Target rocket mass without motor: ~1.2kg (using lightweight materials)
- Total mass with motor: ~3.0kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 1533.9N / (3.0kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 52 (excellent for quick rail exit)

```

This design optimizes the Pro75M1670 configuration by:
1. Reducing overall weight through optimized dimensions and materials
2. Improving aerodynamics with a von Karman nose cone and optimized fin design
3. Minimizing body diameter while maintaining structural integrity
4. Optimizing launch angle to compensate for wind
5. Reducing payload mass to minimum

The design balances performance, structural integrity, and cost-effectiveness to reach the target apogee while ensuring a safe landing and minimizing horizontal drift in the specified wind conditions.
