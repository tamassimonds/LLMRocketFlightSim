# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing all eight previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns and trends:

| Attempt | Motor | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Score |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| 8 | Pro75M1670 | 2573.87 | 15.56% | PASSED | 704.77 | 69.80 |
| 1 | Pro75M1670 | 2447.52 | 19.70% | PASSED | 619.70 | 74.92 |
| 7 | Pro75M1670 | 2453.77 | 19.50% | PASSED | 602.65 | 73.59 |
| 3 | Pro75M1670 | 2280.61 | 25.18% | PASSED | 610.15 | 73.80 |
| 4 | AeroTechK700W | 1819.67 | 40.30% | PASSED | 296.84 | 68.18 |
| 5 | AeroTechK700W | 2019.49 | 33.74% | FAILED | 211.36 | 61.92 |
| 6 | CesaroniO3700 | 534.97 | 82.45% | PASSED | 2359.35 | 30.78 |
| 2 | CesaroniK160 | 398.21 | 86.94% | FAILED | 242.67 | 29.89 |

Key insights:
1. The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently performed best, with attempt #8 reaching 2573.87m (84.44% of target)
2. We need to increase altitude by ~15.6% from our best attempt
3. Carbon fiber materials in attempt #8 improved performance but increased cost
4. The O-class motors are too powerful and expensive for our needs
5. The K-class and H-class motors are insufficient for our target altitude

## Motor Selection for Final Attempt

Since the Pro75M1670 has consistently gotten us closest to our target, I'll continue with this motor but need to optimize further to increase altitude by approximately 15.6%.

## Altitude Optimization Strategy

To increase altitude from 2573.87m to 3048m with the same motor:

1. **Further Weight Reduction**:
   - Use a combination of carbon fiber (for critical components) and fiberglass (where appropriate) to optimize the strength-to-weight ratio while managing cost
   - Further minimize dimensions while ensuring stability
   - Reduce fin size to absolute minimum needed for stability

2. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Use a von Karman nose cone (optimal aerodynamic shape)
   - Further reduce body diameter if possible
   - Optimize fin shape for minimal drag

3. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Use a perfectly vertical launch (90°) to maximize altitude
   - Rely on the rocket's natural weathercocking to handle the wind

## Detailed Design Calculations

For Pro75M1670:
- Motor radius: 75mm = 0.075m
- Minimum body radius: 0.076m (provides 1mm clearance - absolute minimum)
- Target rocket mass without motor: ~0.9kg (using optimized materials)
- Total mass with motor: ~2.7kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 1533.9N / (2.7kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 58 (excellent for quick rail exit)

```

This design represents the ultimate optimization of the Pro75M1670 configuration:

1. **Extreme Weight Reduction**: 
   - Carbon fiber throughout for optimal strength-to-weight ratio
   - Absolute minimum body radius (just 1mm clearance for motor)
   - Minimized wall thickness, payload mass, and overall dimensions
   - Reduced fin size to absolute minimum needed for stability

2. **Optimized Aerodynamics**: 
   - Von Karman nose cone for optimal drag reduction
   - Minimized body diameter and length
   - Streamlined fin design

3. **Launch Configuration**: 
   - Perfectly vertical launch (90°) to maximize altitude
   - Relying on the rocket's natural weathercocking to handle the wind

This design pushes the limits of weight reduction and aerodynamic optimization while maintaining structural integrity, which should provide the ~15.6% increase in altitude needed to reach our target of 3048m.
