# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Looking at the previous attempts, I can see some clear patterns:

1. **First attempt**: Used Pro75M1670 motor, reached 2447.52m (19.7% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $619.70
2. **Second attempt**: Used CesaroniK160 motor, reached only 398.21m (86.94% below target), failed structural integrity, cost $242.67

The first attempt was underpowered but structurally sound, while the second attempt was severely underpowered and structurally failed. The CesaroniK160 motor clearly doesn't provide enough impulse for our target altitude.

## Motor Selection Analysis

For a 3048m apogee, I need to select a motor with appropriate impulse. Let's analyze the available motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Burn Time (s) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 3.9 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 3.5 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 3.6 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 1.29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 8.2 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 5.2 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 9.7 |

Since the Pro75M1670 reached about 80% of our target altitude, we need approximately 25% more impulse. The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse but is heavier, which would reduce altitude. The O-class motors have far too much impulse and would cause significant overshoot and higher costs.

The AeroTechK700W has about 37% of the impulse of the Pro75M1670, which is insufficient. However, if we combine this with a significantly lighter rocket design, we might be able to reach our target altitude with better cost efficiency.

Let's try the Pro75M1670 again but with an optimized design that reduces weight and drag.

## Rocket Body Optimization

For the Pro75M1670 motor (75mm radius):
- Body radius: 0.08m (slightly larger than motor radius)
- Length: 1.0m (reduced from previous 1.1m to save weight)
- Material: Fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio at reasonable cost)
- Thickness: 0.0025m (reduced from previous 0.003m to save weight while maintaining structural integrity)

## Aerodynamic Considerations

- **Nose cone**: Von Karman shape for optimal aerodynamic performance
- **Fins**: 4 fins for better stability in wind conditions
- **Fin material**: Carbon fiber for strength with minimal weight
- **Fin dimensions**: Optimized for stability while minimizing drag

## Recovery System

For a safe landing (< 5 m/s) with an estimated rocket mass of ~3kg:
- Terminal velocity = √(2mg/ρACD)
- For v < 5 m/s, CD_S ≈ 2.4 m²

## Wind Compensation

With 20 m/s easterly winds, I'll angle the launch rail into the wind:
- Launch inclination: 86 degrees (slightly off vertical)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, into the wind)

```

This design optimizes the previous Pro75M1670 configuration by:
1. Reducing overall weight through optimized dimensions
2. Improving aerodynamics with a von Karman nose cone
3. Using carbon fiber fins for better strength-to-weight ratio
4. Adjusting the parachute size for safe landing
5. Optimizing launch angle to compensate for wind

The design balances performance, structural integrity, and cost-effectiveness to reach the target apogee while ensuring a safe landing and minimizing horizontal drift in the specified wind conditions.
