# Rocket Design Analysis

## Initial Considerations

To design a rocket that reaches a target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) in 20 m/s easterly winds, I need to balance several factors:

1. **Motor selection**: Must provide enough thrust to reach target apogee without excessive overshoot
2. **Aerodynamic stability**: Critical for maintaining controlled flight in windy conditions
3. **Weight optimization**: Lighter rockets reach higher altitudes with the same motor
4. **Recovery system**: Must ensure safe landing (< 5 m/s impact velocity)
5. **Cost efficiency**: Lower cost improves overall score

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I'll analyze the available motors to find one with appropriate total impulse for our target altitude:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | Low |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | Very Low |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | High |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | Low |

For a 3048m apogee, a medium-impulse motor like the Pro75M1670 or CesaroniM1670 should be sufficient. The O-class motors would likely cause significant overshoot and are more expensive. The H and K class motors might be underpowered.

Between Pro75M1670 and CesaroniM1670, the Pro75M1670 has the same impulse but lower mass, making it more efficient for our purposes.

## Rocket Body Design

For a medium-powered rocket:
- Body radius: Should be slightly larger than motor radius (75mm = 0.075m for Pro75M1670)
- Length: Approximately 1.0-1.2m for stability and component housing
- Material: Balsa wood or fiberglass offers good strength-to-weight ratio at reasonable cost

## Aerodynamic Considerations

- **Nose cone**: Ogive shape provides good aerodynamic performance
- **Fins**: 3-4 fins with moderate size for stability in wind
- **Center of Pressure (CP)**: Must be behind Center of Gravity (CG) by at least 1 caliber (1 body diameter)

## Recovery System

For a safe landing (< 5 m/s):
- Main parachute CD_S calculation: 
  - For a rocket mass of ~3-4 kg
  - Terminal velocity = √(2mg/ρACD)
  - For v < 5 m/s, CD_S ≈ 2.5-3.0 m²

## Wind Compensation

With 20 m/s easterly winds, I'll angle the launch rail slightly into the wind (westward) to compensate for drift:
- Launch inclination: 85-88 degrees (slightly off vertical)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, into the wind)

## Final Design Configuration

Based on these calculations and considerations, here's my optimized rocket design:

```python

    },
    "parachutes": {

            "trigger": "apogee",

            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.3,  # Drogue parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.5,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 87,   # Rail inclination in degrees (slightly angled into wind)
        "heading": 270,      # Launch heading in degrees (west, into the wind)
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.4  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design balances performance, stability, and cost-effectiveness to reach the target apogee while ensuring a safe landing and minimizing horizontal drift in the specified wind conditions.
