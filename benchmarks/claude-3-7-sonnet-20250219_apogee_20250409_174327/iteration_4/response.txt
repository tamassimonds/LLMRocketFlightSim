# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Analyzing the three previous attempts reveals important patterns:

1. **First attempt**: Pro75M1670 motor → 2447.52m (19.7% below target), structurally sound, $619.70
2. **Second attempt**: CesaroniK160 motor → 398.21m (86.94% below target), structural failure, $242.67
3. **Third attempt**: Pro75M1670 motor → 2280.61m (25.18% below target), structurally sound, $610.15

The Pro75M1670 motor gets us closest to our target but still falls short. We need more impulse without significantly increasing cost or weight.

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

Looking at our available motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Burn Time (s) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 3.9 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 3.5 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 3.6 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 1.29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 8.2 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 5.2 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 9.7 |

Since we're consistently undershooting with the Pro75M1670, we need a motor with more impulse. The AeroTechK700W has insufficient impulse. The O-class motors have excessive impulse and would be too expensive.

The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse as Pro75M1670 but is heavier, which would reduce altitude. However, we could try the AeroTechK700W with a significantly lighter and more aerodynamic design.

## Altitude Estimation

Using a simplified rocket equation:
- Altitude ∝ (Total Impulse / Rocket Mass)

With Pro75M1670, we reached ~2350m (average of attempts 1 & 3)
To reach 3048m (30% increase), we need either:
1. 30% more impulse with the same mass
2. 23% less mass with the same impulse
3. Some combination of both

## New Design Approach

Let's try the AeroTechK700W motor with an ultra-lightweight design:

1. **Motor**: AeroTechK700W (2249 Ns, 0.732 kg)
   - Much lighter than Pro75M1670 (1.815 kg)
   - About 37% of the impulse

2. **Weight Reduction Strategy**:
   - Minimum body radius to fit motor (54mm + margin)
   - Thinner walls using carbon fiber for strength
   - Minimal fin size for stability
   - Lightweight nose cone
   - Reduced payload mass

3. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - Von Karman nose cone for minimum drag
   - Optimized fin shape
   - Smooth transitions

## Detailed Calculations

For AeroTechK700W:
- Motor radius: 54mm = 0.054m
- Body radius: 0.06m (provides 6mm clearance)
- Estimated rocket mass without motor: ~0.8kg
- Total mass with motor: ~1.5kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 658.7N / (1.5kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 44.8 (excellent for quick rail exit)

```

This design takes a completely different approach by using a smaller motor with a much lighter rocket. The carbon fiber construction throughout provides excellent strength-to-weight ratio. The von Karman nose cone offers optimal aerodynamic performance. The launch angle compensates for the easterly winds to minimize horizontal drift.
