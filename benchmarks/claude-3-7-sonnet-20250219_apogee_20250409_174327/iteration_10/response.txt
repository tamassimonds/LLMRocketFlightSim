# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing all nine previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns and trends:

| Attempt | Motor | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Score |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| 9 | Pro75M1670 | 2630.01 | 13.71% | PASSED | 678.45 | 71.53 |
| 8 | Pro75M1670 | 2573.87 | 15.56% | PASSED | 704.77 | 69.80 |
| 1 | Pro75M1670 | 2447.52 | 19.70% | PASSED | 619.70 | 74.92 |
| 7 | Pro75M1670 | 2453.77 | 19.50% | PASSED | 602.65 | 73.59 |
| 3 | Pro75M1670 | 2280.61 | 25.18% | PASSED | 610.15 | 73.80 |

Key insights:
1. The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently performed best, with attempt #9 reaching 2630.01m (86.29% of target)
2. We need to increase altitude by ~13.7% from our best attempt
3. Each optimization with the Pro75M1670 has incrementally improved performance
4. We need to find the perfect balance of weight reduction, aerodynamic efficiency, and structural integrity

## Final Optimization Strategy

To increase altitude from 2630.01m to 3048m with the Pro75M1670 motor:

1. **Material Selection Optimization**:
   - Use carbon fiber for critical components (nose cone, fins)
   - Use fiberglass for body to reduce cost while maintaining good strength-to-weight ratio
   - This balances performance and cost considerations

2. **Extreme Weight Reduction**:
   - Further reduce body length and wall thickness to absolute minimums
   - Optimize fin dimensions for minimum weight while maintaining stability
   - Reduce payload mass to absolute minimum

3. **Aerodynamic Refinement**:
   - Use a tangent ogive nose cone (excellent balance of drag reduction and stability)
   - Optimize fin shape for minimal drag
   - Minimize body diameter to absolute minimum that can accommodate the motor

4. **Launch Configuration Optimization**:
   - Use a perfectly vertical launch (90°) to maximize altitude
   - Use a longer rail length for better initial stability

## Detailed Design Calculations

For Pro75M1670:
- Motor radius: 75mm = 0.075m
- Minimum body radius: 0.0755m (provides 0.5mm clearance - absolute minimum)
- Target rocket mass without motor: ~0.8kg (using optimized materials)
- Total mass with motor: ~2.6kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 1533.9N / (2.6kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 60 (excellent for quick rail exit)

This design represents the ultimate optimization of the Pro75M1670 configuration:

1. **Material Optimization**: 
   - Carbon fiber for critical components (nose cone, fins)
   - Fiberglass for body and tail to reduce cost while maintaining good performance

2. **Extreme Weight Reduction**: 
   - Absolute minimum body radius (just 0.5mm clearance for motor)
   - Minimized wall thickness, payload mass, and overall dimensions
   - Reduced fin size to absolute minimum needed for stability

3. **Aerodynamic Optimization**: 
   - Tangent ogive nose cone for excellent drag reduction and stability
   - Minimized body diameter and length
   - Streamlined fin design

4. **Launch Configuration**: 
   - Perfectly vertical launch (90°) to maximize altitude
   - Longer rail length for better initial stability

This design pushes the absolute limits of weight reduction and aerodynamic optimization while maintaining structural integrity, which should provide the ~13.7% increase in altitude needed to reach our target of 3048m.
