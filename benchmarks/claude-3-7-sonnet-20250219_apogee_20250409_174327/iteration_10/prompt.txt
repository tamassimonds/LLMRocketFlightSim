# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 20 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

# Rocket Design Analysis

## Initial Considerations

To design a rocket that reaches a target apogee of 3048 meters (10,000 ft) in 20 m/s easterly winds, I need to balance several factors:

1. **Motor selection**: Must provide enough thrust to reach target apogee without excessive overshoot
2. **Aerodynamic stability**: Critical for maintaining controlled flight in windy conditions
3. **Weight optimization**: Lighter rockets reach higher altitudes with the same motor
4. **Recovery system**: Must ensure safe landing (< 5 m/s impact velocity)
5. **Cost efficiency**: Lower cost improves overall score

## Motor Selection Analysis

First, I'll analyze the available motors to find one with appropriate total impulse for our target altitude:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Cost Factor |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | Low |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | Very Low |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | High |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | Low |

For a 3048m apogee, a medium-impulse motor like the Pro75M1670 or CesaroniM1670 should be sufficient. The O-class motors would likely cause significant overshoot and are more expensive. The H and K class motors might be underpowered.

Between Pro75M1670 and CesaroniM1670, the Pro75M1670 has the same impulse but lower mass, making it more efficient for our purposes.

## Rocket Body Design

For a medium-powered rocket:
- Body radius: Should be slightly larger than motor radius (75mm = 0.075m for Pro75M1670)
- Length: Approximately 1.0-1.2m for stability and component housing
- Material: Balsa wood or fiberglass offers good strength-to-weight ratio at reasonable cost

## Aerodynamic Considerations

- **Nose cone**: Ogive shape provides good aerodynamic performance
- **Fins**: 3-4 fins with moderate size for stability in wind
- **Center of Pressure (CP)**: Must be behind Center of Gravity (CG) by at least 1 caliber (1 body diameter)

## Recovery System

For a safe landing (< 5 m/s):
- Main parachute CD_S calculation: 
  - For a rocket mass of ~3-4 kg
  - Terminal velocity = √(2mg/ρACD)
  - For v < 5 m/s, CD_S ≈ 2.5-3.0 m²

## Wind Compensation

With 20 m/s easterly winds, I'll angle the launch rail slightly into the wind (westward) to compensate for drift:
- Launch inclination: 85-88 degrees (slightly off vertical)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, into the wind)

## Final Design Configuration

Based on these calculations and considerations, here's my optimized rocket design:

```python
config = {
    "motor_choice": "Pro75M1670",
    "rocket_body": {
        "radius": 0.08,  # Body radius in meters (slightly larger than motor radius)

            "span": 0.08,        # Fin span in meters
            "cant_angle": 0,     # Cant angle in degrees
            "material": "plywood",
            "thickness": 0.004   # Fin thickness in meters
        },
        "tail": {
            "length": 0.2,  # Tail length in meters
            "top_radius": 0.075,  # Top radius in meters
            "bottom_radius": 0.08,  # Bottom radius in meters
            "material": "fiberglass",
        },
    },
    "parachutes": {
        "main": {
            "name": "Main",
            "cd_s": 2.8,  # Main parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
        "drogue": {
            "name": "Drogue",
            "cd_s": 0.3,  # Drogue parachute CD_s
            "trigger": "apogee",
            "sampling_rate": 105,
            "lag": 1.5,
            "noise": (0, 8.3, 0.5),
        },
    },
    "launch": {
        "rail_length": 1.5,  # Length of the launch rail in meters
        "inclination": 87,   # Rail inclination in degrees (slightly angled into wind)
        "heading": 270,      # Launch heading in degrees (west, into the wind)
    },
    "payload": {
        "mass": 0.3,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.4  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design balances performance, stability, and cost-effectiveness to reach the target apogee while ensuring a safe landing and minimizing horizontal drift in the specified wind conditions.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analyzing Previous Attempt

The previous design scored 74.92/100 with an actual apogee of 2447.52m, which is 19.70% below our target of 3048m. The rocket maintained structural integrity and had a reasonable cost of $619.70, but we need to increase the apogee while maintaining other performance metrics.

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

Looking at the previous motor choice (Pro75M1670), we need more impulse to reach our target altitude. Let's analyze the motors again:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Approx. Cost |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | Medium |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | Low |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | Medium |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | Very Low |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | High |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | High |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | Low |

Since we undershot by about 20%, we need more impulse. The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse as Pro75M1670 but is heavier, so that's not ideal. The AeroTechK700W has less impulse, which would worsen our undershoot.

Let's try the CesaroniK160. While it has less total impulse than Pro75M1670, it has a much better thrust-to-weight ratio (lower mass), which could be advantageous if we optimize the rest of the rocket design to be lighter.

## Weight Optimization

To reach a higher apogee with the CesaroniK160 motor:
1. Reduce overall rocket weight by using lighter materials
2. Optimize aerodynamic design to reduce drag
3. Adjust dimensions for better performance

## Aerodynamic Refinements

- Reduce body radius to minimize drag while maintaining stability
- Use lightweight but strong materials (balsa wood for fins, carbon fiber for critical components)
- Optimize nose cone shape for minimum drag (von Karman or elliptical)
- Reduce fin size to minimize drag while maintaining stability

## Recovery System Adjustments

We'll keep a similar recovery system design but slightly reduce the main parachute size to optimize for the lighter rocket.

## Wind Compensation Strategy

With 20 m/s easterly winds, we'll maintain a slight westward launch angle:
- Launch inclination: 85 degrees (slightly off vertical)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, into the wind)

## Thrust-to-Weight Ratio Calculation

For CesaroniK160:
- Average thrust: 190.2 N
- Estimated rocket mass (with motor): ~1.5 kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 190.2 / (1.5 × 9.81) ≈ 12.9

This is a good thrust-to-weight ratio for our purposes, allowing rapid acceleration off the launch rail.

}
```

This design focuses on creating an ultra-lightweight rocket with optimized aerodynamics to maximize altitude with the CesaroniK160 motor. The carbon fiber components provide excellent strength-to-weight ratio, while the balsa wood fins further reduce weight. The von Karman nose cone offers optimal aerodynamic performance for transonic flight. The launch angle compensates for the easterly winds to minimize horizontal drift.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Looking at the previous attempts, I can see some clear patterns:

1. **First attempt**: Used Pro75M1670 motor, reached 2447.52m (19.7% below target), passed structural integrity, cost $619.70
2. **Second attempt**: Used CesaroniK160 motor, reached only 398.21m (86.94% below target), failed structural integrity, cost $242.67

The first attempt was underpowered but structurally sound, while the second attempt was severely underpowered and structurally failed. The CesaroniK160 motor clearly doesn't provide enough impulse for our target altitude.

## Motor Selection Analysis

For a 3048m apogee, I need to select a motor with appropriate impulse. Let's analyze the available motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Burn Time (s) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 3.9 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 3.5 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 3.6 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 1.29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 8.2 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 5.2 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 9.7 |

Since the Pro75M1670 reached about 80% of our target altitude, we need approximately 25% more impulse. The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse but is heavier, which would reduce altitude. The O-class motors have far too much impulse and would cause significant overshoot and higher costs.

The AeroTechK700W has about 37% of the impulse of the Pro75M1670, which is insufficient. However, if we combine this with a significantly lighter rocket design, we might be able to reach our target altitude with better cost efficiency.

Let's try the Pro75M1670 again but with an optimized design that reduces weight and drag.

## Rocket Body Optimization

For the Pro75M1670 motor (75mm radius):
- Body radius: 0.08m (slightly larger than motor radius)
- Length: 1.0m (reduced from previous 1.1m to save weight)
- Material: Fiberglass (good strength-to-weight ratio at reasonable cost)
- Thickness: 0.0025m (reduced from previous 0.003m to save weight while maintaining structural integrity)

## Aerodynamic Considerations

- **Nose cone**: Von Karman shape for optimal aerodynamic performance
- **Fins**: 4 fins for better stability in wind conditions
- **Fin material**: Carbon fiber for strength with minimal weight
- **Fin dimensions**: Optimized for stability while minimizing drag

## Recovery System

For a safe landing (< 5 m/s) with an estimated rocket mass of ~3kg:
- Terminal velocity = √(2mg/ρACD)
- For v < 5 m/s, CD_S ≈ 2.4 m²

## Wind Compensation

With 20 m/s easterly winds, I'll angle the launch rail into the wind:
- Launch inclination: 86 degrees (slightly off vertical)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, into the wind)

## Final Design Configuration

        "mass": 0.25,  # Payload mass in kg
        "position": 0.35  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters

}
```

This design optimizes the previous Pro75M1670 configuration by:
1. Reducing overall weight through optimized dimensions
2. Improving aerodynamics with a von Karman nose cone
3. Using carbon fiber fins for better strength-to-weight ratio
4. Adjusting the parachute size for safe landing
5. Optimizing launch angle to compensate for wind

The design balances performance, structural integrity, and cost-effectiveness to reach the target apogee while ensuring a safe landing and minimizing horizontal drift in the specified wind conditions.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Analyzing the three previous attempts reveals important patterns:

1. **First attempt**: Pro75M1670 motor → 2447.52m (19.7% below target), structurally sound, $619.70
2. **Second attempt**: CesaroniK160 motor → 398.21m (86.94% below target), structural failure, $242.67
3. **Third attempt**: Pro75M1670 motor → 2280.61m (25.18% below target), structurally sound, $610.15

The Pro75M1670 motor gets us closest to our target but still falls short. We need more impulse without significantly increasing cost or weight.

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

Looking at our available motors:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Burn Time (s) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 3.9 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 3.5 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 3.6 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 1.29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 8.2 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 5.2 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 9.7 |

Since we're consistently undershooting with the Pro75M1670, we need a motor with more impulse. The AeroTechK700W has insufficient impulse. The O-class motors have excessive impulse and would be too expensive.

The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse as Pro75M1670 but is heavier, which would reduce altitude. However, we could try the AeroTechK700W with a significantly lighter and more aerodynamic design.

## Altitude Estimation

Using a simplified rocket equation:
- Altitude ∝ (Total Impulse / Rocket Mass)

With Pro75M1670, we reached ~2350m (average of attempts 1 & 3)
To reach 3048m (30% increase), we need either:
1. 30% more impulse with the same mass
2. 23% less mass with the same impulse
3. Some combination of both

## New Design Approach

Let's try the AeroTechK700W motor with an ultra-lightweight design:

1. **Motor**: AeroTechK700W (2249 Ns, 0.732 kg)
   - Much lighter than Pro75M1670 (1.815 kg)
   - About 37% of the impulse

2. **Weight Reduction Strategy**:
   - Minimum body radius to fit motor (54mm + margin)
   - Thinner walls using carbon fiber for strength
   - Minimal fin size for stability
   - Lightweight nose cone
   - Reduced payload mass

3. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - Von Karman nose cone for minimum drag
   - Optimized fin shape
   - Smooth transitions

## Detailed Calculations

For AeroTechK700W:
- Motor radius: 54mm = 0.054m
- Body radius: 0.06m (provides 6mm clearance)
- Estimated rocket mass without motor: ~0.8kg
- Total mass with motor: ~1.5kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 658.7N / (1.5kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 44.8 (excellent for quick rail exit)

        "position": 0.3  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design takes a completely different approach by using a smaller motor with a much lighter rocket. The carbon fiber construction throughout provides excellent strength-to-weight ratio. The von Karman nose cone offers optimal aerodynamic performance. The launch angle compensates for the easterly winds to minimize horizontal drift.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Analysis of Previous Attempts

Looking at the four previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns:

1. **First attempt**: Pro75M1670 motor → 2447.52m (19.7% below target), structurally sound, $619.70
2. **Second attempt**: CesaroniK160 motor → 398.21m (86.94% below target), structural failure, $242.67
3. **Third attempt**: Pro75M1670 motor → 2280.61m (25.18% below target), structurally sound, $610.15
4. **Fourth attempt**: AeroTechK700W motor → 1819.67m (40.30% below target), structurally sound, $296.84

The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently gotten us closest to our target altitude, but still falls short by ~20-25%. The AeroTechK700W with a lightweight design performed better than expected but still fell short by 40%.

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

Based on our previous attempts, we need more impulse than the Pro75M1670 provides, but the O-class motors would likely cause significant overshoot and increase cost unnecessarily.

The CesaroniM1670 has the same impulse as Pro75M1670 (6023.6 Ns) but is heavier (3.101 kg vs 1.815 kg), which would reduce altitude further.

Let's try a different approach with the AeroTechK700W motor. This motor has less impulse (2249 Ns) but is also much lighter (0.732 kg). If we can optimize the rocket design to be extremely lightweight and aerodynamically efficient, we might be able to reach our target altitude with better cost efficiency.

## Altitude Estimation and Optimization

Using the rocket equation approximation and our previous results:
- With Pro75M1670, we reached ~2350m (average of attempts 1 & 3)
- With AeroTechK700W, we reached ~1820m (attempt 4)

The AeroTechK700W attempt showed promise but needs optimization. Let's calculate what we need:
- To reach 3048m from 1820m, we need approximately a 67% increase in performance
- This can be achieved through further weight reduction and drag minimization

## Weight and Drag Optimization Strategy

1. **Material Selection**:
   - Use balsa wood for fins (extremely lightweight)
   - Use fiberglass for body (lighter than carbon fiber but still strong)
   - Minimize wall thickness while maintaining structural integrity

2. **Aerodynamic Optimization**:
   - Elliptical nose cone (good balance of drag reduction and ease of manufacturing)
   - Optimize fin shape for minimum drag
   - Reduce body diameter to absolute minimum that can accommodate the motor

3. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Adjust launch angle to compensate for wind while maximizing vertical component of thrust

## Detailed Calculations

For AeroTechK700W:
- Motor radius: 54mm = 0.054m
- Minimum body radius: 0.057m (provides 3mm clearance)
- Estimated rocket mass without motor: ~0.5kg (using ultralight materials)
- Total mass with motor: ~1.2kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 658.7N / (1.2kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 56 (excellent for quick rail exit)

        "position": 0.25  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design takes the lightweight approach with the AeroTechK700W motor to the extreme. By using balsa wood fins, minimizing body dimensions, and using fiberglass for the body and nose cone, we've created an ultra-lightweight rocket that should achieve significantly better altitude than our previous attempt with the same motor. The launch angle has been adjusted to 88 degrees to provide a better balance between wind compensation and vertical thrust component.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing the five previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns and lessons:

| Attempt | Motor | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Score |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Pro75M1670 | 2447.52 | 19.70% | PASSED | 619.70 | 74.92 |
| 2 | CesaroniK160 | 398.21 | 86.94% | FAILED | 242.67 | 29.89 |
| 3 | Pro75M1670 | 2280.61 | 25.18% | PASSED | 610.15 | 73.80 |
| 4 | AeroTechK700W | 1819.67 | 40.30% | PASSED | 296.84 | 68.18 |
| 5 | AeroTechK700W | 2019.49 | 33.74% | FAILED | 211.36 | 61.92 |

Key observations:
1. The Pro75M1670 motor gets us closest to target but still undershoots by ~20-25%
2. Lightweight designs with AeroTechK700W are cost-effective but underpowered
3. Attempt 5 failed structurally, indicating we pushed the lightweight design too far
4. We need more impulse than Pro75M1670 provides, but not as much as O-class motors

## Motor Selection for Optimal Performance

Looking at our available motors again:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Burn Time (s) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 3.9 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 3.5 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 3.6 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 1.29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 8.2 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 5.2 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 9.7 |

Since we need more impulse than Pro75M1670 provides, but the O-class motors would cause significant overshoot and are expensive, I'll try the CesaroniO3700 motor with a heavier, more robust design that can handle the increased power while still reaching our target apogee.

## Altitude Estimation and Optimization

Using the rocket equation approximation and our previous results:
- With Pro75M1670, we reached ~2350m (average of attempts 1 & 3)
- To reach 3048m (30% increase), we need more impulse

The CesaroniO3700 has about 5 times the impulse of Pro75M1670, but is also much heavier. To prevent overshooting, I'll design a heavier rocket with:
1. Larger diameter to increase drag
2. Stronger materials to ensure structural integrity
3. Larger fins for stability with the more powerful motor

## Structural Integrity Considerations

The CesaroniO3700 produces significantly more thrust (2836.9 N avg) than the motors in our previous attempts. To ensure structural integrity:
1. Use aluminum for the body and tail for maximum strength
2. Use carbon fiber for the nose cone and fins for strength with reasonable weight
3. Increase wall thickness to handle the higher forces

## Wind Compensation Strategy

With 20 m/s easterly winds, I'll angle the launch rail slightly into the wind:
- Launch inclination: 87 degrees (slightly off vertical)
- Heading: 270 degrees (west, into the wind)

## Recovery System Sizing

For a safe landing (< 5 m/s) with a heavier rocket (est. ~18-20 kg):
- Terminal velocity = √(2mg/ρACD)
- For v < 5 m/s, CD_S ≈ 16 m²

This design uses the powerful CesaroniO3700 motor with a robust, heavier rocket design to achieve our target apogee. The aluminum body and tail provide excellent structural integrity to handle the powerful motor, while the carbon fiber nose cone and fins offer a good balance of strength and weight. The larger diameter increases drag to prevent overshooting our target altitude. The recovery system is sized appropriately for the heavier rocket to ensure a safe landing.

# Rocket Design Analysis for 3048m Apogee Target

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing all previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns:

| Attempt | Motor | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Score |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Pro75M1670 | 2447.52 | 19.70% | PASSED | 619.70 | 74.92 |
| 2 | CesaroniK160 | 398.21 | 86.94% | FAILED | 242.67 | 29.89 |
| 3 | Pro75M1670 | 2280.61 | 25.18% | PASSED | 610.15 | 73.80 |
| 4 | AeroTechK700W | 1819.67 | 40.30% | PASSED | 296.84 | 68.18 |
| 5 | AeroTechK700W | 2019.49 | 33.74% | FAILED | 211.36 | 61.92 |
| 6 | CesaroniO3700 | 534.97 | 82.45% | PASSED | 2359.35 | 30.78 |

Key insights:
1. The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently performed best, reaching ~80% of our target altitude
2. Lightweight designs with AeroTechK700W are cost-effective but underpowered
3. The CesaroniO3700 was too heavy and expensive, resulting in poor performance
4. We need to find the right balance between impulse, weight, and structural integrity

## Motor Selection Reconsideration

Looking at our available motors again:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) | Burn Time (s) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 | 3.9 |
| AeroTechK700W | 2249 | 658.7 | 0.732 | 3.5 |
| CesaroniM1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 3.101 | 3.6 |
| AeroTechH128W | 176.5 | 141.2 | 0.108 | 1.29 |
| CesaroniO3700 | 29930.2 | 2836.9 | 14.194 | 8.2 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 | 5.2 |
| CesaroniK160 | 1521.7 | 190.2 | 0.7 | 9.7 |

Since the Pro75M1670 has consistently gotten us closest to our target, I'll stick with this motor but optimize the design to increase altitude by approximately 25%.

## Altitude Optimization Strategy

To increase altitude from ~2350m to 3048m (30% increase) with the same motor:

1. **Weight Reduction**:
   - Use lighter materials where possible
   - Optimize dimensions to minimize weight while maintaining structural integrity
   - Reduce payload mass to minimum

2. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Use an optimized nose cone shape (von Karman)
   - Minimize body diameter while accommodating the motor
   - Optimize fin design for minimal drag

3. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Optimize launch angle to balance wind compensation and vertical thrust

## Detailed Design Calculations

For Pro75M1670:
- Motor radius: 75mm = 0.075m
- Minimum body radius: 0.078m (provides 3mm clearance)
- Target rocket mass without motor: ~1.2kg (using lightweight materials)
- Total mass with motor: ~3.0kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 1533.9N / (3.0kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 52 (excellent for quick rail exit)

        "mass": 0.2,  # Payload mass in kg (minimized)
        "position": 0.3  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design optimizes the Pro75M1670 configuration by:
1. Reducing overall weight through optimized dimensions and materials
2. Improving aerodynamics with a von Karman nose cone and optimized fin design
3. Minimizing body diameter while maintaining structural integrity
4. Optimizing launch angle to compensate for wind
5. Reducing payload mass to minimum

The design balances performance, structural integrity, and cost-effectiveness to reach the target apogee while ensuring a safe landing and minimizing horizontal drift in the specified wind conditions.

## Comprehensive Analysis of Previous Attempts

After analyzing all seven previous attempts, I can identify clear patterns:

| Attempt | Motor | Apogee (m) | Error (%) | Structural | Cost ($) | Score |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Pro75M1670 | 2447.52 | 19.70% | PASSED | 619.70 | 74.92 |

| 2 | CesaroniK160 | 398.21 | 86.94% | FAILED | 242.67 | 29.89 |

Key insights:
1. The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently performed best, reaching ~80% of our target altitude
2. We need to increase altitude by ~20% from our best attempts
3. Attempts with the Pro75M1670 motor have all been structurally sound
4. We need to find the right balance between impulse, weight, and drag

## Motor Selection Analysis

Since the Pro75M1670 has consistently gotten us closest to our target, I'll continue with this motor but need to optimize further to increase altitude by approximately 20%.

Looking at the next step up in our motor options:

| Motor | Total Impulse (Ns) | Avg Thrust (N) | Mass (kg) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Pro75M1670 | 6023.6 | 1533.9 | 1.815 |
| CesaroniO5800 | 30382.7 | 5040.2 | 12.418 |

The CesaroniO5800 has 5x the impulse but is 6.8x heavier and would likely cause significant overshoot. Let's optimize with the Pro75M1670.

## Altitude Optimization Strategy

To increase altitude from ~2450m to 3048m (25% increase) with the same motor:

1. **Weight Reduction**: The most critical factor for increasing altitude
   - Use the lightest possible materials that maintain structural integrity
   - Minimize dimensions while ensuring stability
   - Reduce payload mass to absolute minimum

2. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Use an optimized nose cone shape (elliptical or von Karman)
   - Minimize body diameter to just above motor diameter
   - Optimize fin design for minimal drag while maintaining stability

3. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Optimize launch angle to maximize vertical component of thrust while accounting for wind

## Detailed Design Calculations

For Pro75M1670:
- Motor radius: 75mm = 0.075m
- Minimum body radius: 0.077m (provides 2mm clearance)
- Target rocket mass without motor: ~1.0kg (using ultralight materials)
- Total mass with motor: ~2.8kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 1533.9N / (2.8kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 56 (excellent for quick rail exit)

        "position": 0.25  # Payload position relative to rocket center in meters
    }
}
```

This design represents the ultimate optimization of the Pro75M1670 configuration:

1. **Material Selection**: Carbon fiber throughout provides the best strength-to-weight ratio
2. **Minimized Dimensions**: Body radius is just 2mm larger than the motor radius
3. **Optimized Aerodynamics**: Elliptical nose cone and minimal fin size reduce drag
4. **Weight Reduction**: Minimized wall thickness, payload mass, and overall dimensions
5. **Launch Configuration**: Nearly vertical launch (89°) to maximize altitude while still accounting for wind

The design pushes the limits of weight reduction while maintaining structural integrity, which should provide the ~20% increase in altitude needed to reach our target of 3048m.

Key insights:
1. The Pro75M1670 motor has consistently performed best, with attempt #8 reaching 2573.87m (84.44% of target)
2. We need to increase altitude by ~15.6% from our best attempt
3. Carbon fiber materials in attempt #8 improved performance but increased cost
4. The O-class motors are too powerful and expensive for our needs
5. The K-class and H-class motors are insufficient for our target altitude

## Motor Selection for Final Attempt

Since the Pro75M1670 has consistently gotten us closest to our target, I'll continue with this motor but need to optimize further to increase altitude by approximately 15.6%.

## Altitude Optimization Strategy

To increase altitude from 2573.87m to 3048m with the same motor:

1. **Further Weight Reduction**:
   - Use a combination of carbon fiber (for critical components) and fiberglass (where appropriate) to optimize the strength-to-weight ratio while managing cost
   - Further minimize dimensions while ensuring stability
   - Reduce fin size to absolute minimum needed for stability

2. **Drag Reduction**:
   - Use a von Karman nose cone (optimal aerodynamic shape)
   - Further reduce body diameter if possible
   - Optimize fin shape for minimal drag

3. **Launch Configuration**:
   - Use a perfectly vertical launch (90°) to maximize altitude
   - Rely on the rocket's natural weathercocking to handle the wind

## Detailed Design Calculations

For Pro75M1670:
- Motor radius: 75mm = 0.075m
- Minimum body radius: 0.076m (provides 1mm clearance - absolute minimum)
- Target rocket mass without motor: ~0.9kg (using optimized materials)
- Total mass with motor: ~2.7kg
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 1533.9N / (2.7kg × 9.81m/s²) ≈ 58 (excellent for quick rail exit)

This design represents the ultimate optimization of the Pro75M1670 configuration:

1. **Extreme Weight Reduction**: 
   - Carbon fiber throughout for optimal strength-to-weight ratio
   - Absolute minimum body radius (just 1mm clearance for motor)
   - Minimized wall thickness, payload mass, and overall dimensions
   - Reduced fin size to absolute minimum needed for stability

2. **Optimized Aerodynamics**: 
   - Von Karman nose cone for optimal drag reduction
   - Minimized body diameter and length
   - Streamlined fin design

3. **Launch Configuration**: 
   - Perfectly vertical launch (90°) to maximize altitude
   - Relying on the rocket's natural weathercocking to handle the wind

This design pushes the limits of weight reduction and aerodynamic optimization while maintaining structural integrity, which should provide the ~15.6% increase in altitude needed to reach our target of 3048m.
