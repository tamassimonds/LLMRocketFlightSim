Motor Selection:\n   \u2022 We need a motor that can produce enough impulse to push our rocket to roughly 3048 m (10,000 ft). Looking at the available motors, the \u201cCesaroniO5800\u201d provides a total impulse of roughly 30,382 Ns with an average thrust around 5040 N and a burn time of 5.2 s. This gives us a good thrust\u2010to\u2010weight ratio while keeping the mass moderate.\n   \u2022 Its motor radius is given as 150 mm. Therefore, the rocket body must have a radius greater than 0.15 m.\n\n2. Body Design:\n   \u2022 Chose a body radius slightly larger than the motor radius (0.18 m) for ample internal room and structural margin.\n   \u2022 A body length of about 2.5 m was chosen to accommodate the propulsion, recovery, and aerodynamic components yet remain as lightweight as possible.\n   \u2022 A strong yet cost\u2010efficient material is \u201ccomposite\u201d which offers high strength-to-weight and is available.\n   \u2022 A wall thickness of 0.008 m is chosen to minimize cost and mass while keeping structural integrity.\n\n3. Aerodynamics \u2013 Nose Cone, Fins, and Tail:\n   \u2022 Nose Cone: A classic \u201cogive\u201d shape is chosen with a length of 0.5 m. \u201cFiberglass\u201d is used for its good strength, smooth finish, and light weight.\n   \u2022 Fins: With 4 fins, dimensions were selected for stability. The root chord (0.2 m) and tip chord (0.1 m) and a span of 0.25 m provide enough area for aerodynamic control. A small cant angle (2\u00b0) is included for improved stability. \u201cCarbon_fiber\u201d is selected for its light weight and stiffness with 0.005 m thickness.\n   \u2022 Tail: A fin-like tail structure is included to ensure control. The tail length is set to 0.3 m. Keeping the design within the simulation checks, the top radius is set at 0.04 m and the bottom radius at 0.06 m (note these are not equal as required). \u201cCarbon_fiber\u201d is again chosen for consistency and strength.\n\n4. Parachute Recovery System:\n   \u2022 Both a main and a drogue chute are specified. For a safe landing (impact speed < 5 m/s) the main parachute area is picked slightly larger (cd_s = 0.3) compared to the drogue (cd_s = 0.2) so that after apogee the rocket decelerates sufficiently.\n   \u2022 Both parachutes are triggered at apogee (as per the simulation requirements), with a sampling rate of 105 Hz, a lag time of 1.5 s and a noise tuple representative of the deployment dynamics.\n\n5. Launch Rail:\n   \u2022 A rail length of 3.0 m is chosen. Longer rails give the rocket time to align and help counteract a 5 m/s crosswind by providing a stable initial ascent.\n   \u2022 The inclination is set at 90\u00b0 (for a vertical launch) and the heading remains 0\u00b0 (since wind from the east will shift the trajectory slightly, but the recovery system and guidance will handle the offset).\n\n6. Payload:\n   \u2022 A modest payload of 0.5 kg is assumed and it is placed half a meter from the rocket\u2019s center so that its mass is contained within the stability envelope.\n\nAll design choices have been checked against the simulation constraints:\n   \u2022 The motor and body dimensions agree (body radius > motor radius).\n   \u2022 The aerodynamic tail satisfies the condition that top and bottom radii differ.\n   \u2022 The choice of materials uses only those available.\n   \u2022 The parachutes and rail settings are chosen to help safe recovery even in moderate cross-winds.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal configuration in Python dictionary format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nconfig = {\n    \"motor_choice\": \"CesaroniO5800\",\n    \"rocket_body\": {\n        \"radius\": 0.18,               # in meters (greater than motor radius 0.15 m)\n        \"length\": 2.5,                # in meters overall body length\n        \"material\": \"composite\",      # selected for strength with low mass\n        \"thickness\": 0.008,           # wall thickness in meters\n    },\n    \"aerodynamics\": {\n        \"nose_cone\": {\n            \"kind\": \"ogive\",        # smooth aerodynamic shape\n            \"length\": 0.5,          # length of nose cone in meters\n            \"material\": \"fiberglass\",  # chosen for smooth finish and light weight\n        },\n        \"fins\": {\n            \"number\": 4,\n            \"root_chord\": 0.2,      # in meters for adequate lift at the root\n            \"tip_chord\": 0.1,       # in meters for proper tapering\n            \"span\": 0.25,           # fin span in meters\n            \"cant_angle\": 2,        # cant angle in degrees\n            \"material\": \"carbon_fiber\", \n            \"thickness\": 0.005,     # in meters\n        },\n        \"tail\": {\n            \"length\": 0.3,          # tail length in meters\n            \"top_radius\": 0.04,       # top radius in meters\n            \"bottom_radius\": 0.06,    # bottom radius in meters (different from top)\n            \"material\": \"carbon_fiber\",\n        },\n    },\n    \"parachutes\": {\n        \"main\": {\n            \"name\": \"Main\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.3,            # increased area for safe deceleration\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n        \"drogue\": {\n            \"name\": \"Drogue\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.2,            # smaller drogue chute for early slowdown\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n    },\n    \"launch\": {\n        \"rail_length\": 3.0,         # longer rail for improved stability against wind\n        \"inclination\": 90,          # vertical launch (90\u00b0)\n        \"heading\": 0,               # heading in degrees (north/up)\n    },\n    \"payload\": { \n        \"mass\": 0.5,              # payload mass in kg\n        \"position\": 0.5,          # position relative to rocket center in meters\n    },\n}\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nThis configuration is designed to reach the 3048 m target apogee while keeping cost down, ensuring safe recovery (impact speed less than 5 m/s), and meeting all simulation constraints.",

Motor Selection:\n   \u2022 To reach an apogee of 3048 m, we need a motor with high total impulse. The \u201cCesaroniO5800\u201d offers roughly 30,382.7 Ns of impulse with an average thrust of 5040.2 N, which is well suited for our target.\n   \u2022 Its stated radius is 150 mm (0.15 m). That means our rocket\u2019s body radius must exceed 0.15 m.\n\n2. Rocket Body:\n   \u2022 We choose a body radius of 0.17 m\u2014large enough to clear the motor and allow internal components without excessive mass.\n   \u2022 A slightly longer body (3.0 m overall length) gives more internal volume while helping with aerodynamic stability and reducing cost through simpler construction.\n   \u2022 The material selected is \u201ccomposite\u201d because it provides a good strength\u2010to\u2010weight ratio at a reasonable cost.\n   \u2022 A wall thickness of 0.008 m is chosen to keep the structure both strong and cost effective.\n\n3. Nose Cone:\n   \u2022 The \u201cogive\u201d shape is chosen for its low drag characteristics.\n   \u2022 A nose cone length of 0.6 m offers a smooth transition, reducing aerodynamic disturbances.\n   \u2022 \u201cfiberglass\u201d is used as it is light, strong, and available in our materials list.\n\n4. Fin and Tail Design:\n   \u2022 For stability, we use 4 fins.\n   \u2022 The fins have a root chord of 0.25 m and a tip chord of 0.125 m. The span is set to 0.3 m, enough to provide the desired aerodynamic control.\n   \u2022 A cant angle of 3\u00b0 is added to optimize airflow and improve yaw stability.\n   \u2022 \u201ccarbon_fiber\u201d is selected for the fins to ensure rigidity without an excessive mass penalty. The fin thickness is 0.005 m.\n   \u2022 For the tail, we use a short, fin-like structure with a length of 0.4 m.\n   \u2022 To satisfy the design check that the tail\u2019s top and bottom radii differ, we set the top radius to 0.05 m and bottom radius to 0.07 m.\n   \u2022 The tail material is also \u201ccarbon_fiber\u201d to maintain strength and consistency with the fins.\n\n5. Parachute Recovery System:\n   \u2022 For the main chute, a slightly larger effective area is chosen (cd_s = 0.35) to ensure that the rocket decelerates sufficiently for a safe landing (target landing speed < 5 m/s).\n   \u2022 The drogue parachute uses a cd_s value of 0.25, giving an early drag boost as it comes out upon reaching apogee.\n   \u2022 Both are triggered at apogee with a sampling rate set to 105 Hz, a lag of 1.5 s, and the same noise tuple (0, 8.3, 0.5).\n\n6. Launch Rail Configuration:\n   \u2022 A rail length of 3.5 m provides a good balance: long enough to stabilize the rocket against a 5 m/s crosswind from the east but not so long as to add unnecessary cost.\n   \u2022 An inclination of 90\u00b0 is used to ensure a vertical launch and counteract lateral drift.\n   \u2022 The heading is set to 0\u00b0 (i.e. straight upward) to keep the initial ascent as vertical as possible.\n\n7. Payload:\n   \u2022 A payload mass of 0.3 kg is assumed. Its position is set 0.6 m from the rocket\u2019s center to keep the mass near the middle for optimal stability.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal configuration in Python dictionary format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nconfig = {\n    \"motor_choice\": \"CesaroniO5800\",\n    \"rocket_body\": {\n        \"radius\": 0.17,               # in meters, ensuring > motor radius (0.15 m)\n        \"length\": 3.0,                # overall body length in meters\n        \"material\": \"composite\",      # cost-effective with high strength-to-weight ratio\n        \"thickness\": 0.008,           # wall thickness in meters\n    },\n    \"aerodynamics\": {\n        \"nose_cone\": {\n            \"kind\": \"ogive\",          # low-drag aerodynamic shape\n            \"length\": 0.6,            # nose cone length in meters\n            \"material\": \"fiberglass\", # smooth finish, light weight\n        },\n        \"fins\": {\n            \"number\": 4,\n            \"root_chord\": 0.25,       # in meters, providing sufficient lift at the base\n            \"tip_chord\": 0.125,       # in meters, tapering for reduced drag\n            \"span\": 0.3,              # fin span in meters for control\n            \"cant_angle\": 3,          # slight cant to improve directional stability\n            \"material\": \"carbon_fiber\", \n            \"thickness\": 0.005,       # fin thickness in meters\n        },\n        \"tail\": {\n            \"length\": 0.4,            # tail length in meters for aerodynamic correction\n            \"top_radius\": 0.05,         # top radius in meters (different from bottom)\n            \"bottom_radius\": 0.07,      # bottom radius in meters\n            \"material\": \"carbon_fiber\",\n        },\n    },\n    \"parachutes\": {\n        \"main\": {\n            \"name\": \"Main\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.35,             # larger area for safe deceleration\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n        \"drogue\": {\n            \"name\": \"Drogue\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.25,             # smaller chute for initial drag\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n    },\n    \"launch\": {\n        \"rail_length\": 3.5,           # longer rail for improved stability against wind\n        \"inclination\": 90,            # vertical launch (90\u00b0)\n        \"heading\": 0,                 # heading in degrees (straight up)\n    },\n    \"payload\": { \n        \"mass\": 0.3,                # payload mass in kg\n        \"position\": 0.6,            # payload\u2019s position relative to rocket center in meters\n    },\n}\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nThis design makes a balanced compromise between cost, safety, and performance.

Motor Selection:\n   \u2022 To reach a 3048\u2011meter apogee, we need ample total impulse. Although there are several motor options, the \u201cCesaroniO5800\u201d (impulse \u2248 30382.7 Ns, avg thrust \u22485040 N over 5.2 s, and a dry mass of 12.418 kg) gives us the power necessary for the high altitude.\n   \u2022 Its motor radius is 150 mm (0.15 m), so our rocket body must have a radius larger than that.\n\n2. Rocket Body:\n   \u2022 To minimize cost (and mass) while keeping structural integrity, I\u2019ve chosen a body radius of 0.17 m \u2013 just enough clearance above the motor.\n   \u2022 The body length is set to 2.8 m. This is long enough to house the motor, recovery system and provide aerodynamic stability without unnecessarily adding mass.\n   \u2022 Material \u201ccomposite\u201d is used because it offers a good strength\u2010to\u2010weight ratio. (Although sometimes more expensive, safety is paramount to avoid structural failure.)\n   \u2022 I\u2019ve increased the wall thickness slightly to 0.009 m compared to previous attempts to ensure the structure can comfortably handle the heavy motor and high thrust loads.\n\n3. Aerodynamics:\n   a. Nose Cone:\n      \u2022 An \u201cogive\u201d shape is known for low drag. I\u2019ve lengthened the nose cone to 0.7 m for a smooth transition and to improve aerodynamic performance.\n      \u2022 \u201cfiberglass\u201d is used for the nose cone because of its smooth finish and light weight.\n   \n   b. Fins:\n      \u2022 Four fins are included for enhanced stability. Their dimensions are chosen to provide sufficient control while keeping them light.\n      \u2022 I use a root chord of 0.20 m and tip chord of 0.10 m with a span of 0.30 m. A very slight cant angle of 1\u00b0 is added so that any small yaw perturbations are damped while not producing excessive side forces.\n      \u2022 \u201ccarbon_fiber\u201d is selected for the fins due to its high stiffness and light weight; the thickness is 0.005 m.\n   \n   c. Tail:\n      \u2022 The tail (separate from the fins) is designed with a length of 0.5 m.\n      \u2022 To satisfy the simulation check that the top and bottom radii differ, I\u2019ve chosen a top radius of 0.04 m and a bottom radius of 0.06 m.\n      \u2022 \u201ccarbon_fiber\u201d is again used for the tail for consistency and strength.\n\n4. Parachute Recovery System:\n   \u2022 For a safe landing (impact speed under 5 m/s) and to minimize horizontal drift, the main parachute is given a larger effective drag (cd_s = 0.4). The drogue chute is sized slightly smaller (cd_s = 0.3) so that it provides early drag while the main chute ensures a gentle touchdown.\n   \u2022 Both chutes deploy at apogee (trigger set to \u201capogee\u201d), with a sampling rate of 105 Hz, a deployment lag of 1.5 s, and a noise tuple of (0, 8.3, 0.5).\n\n5. Launch Rail Configuration:\n   \u2022 To help counter the 5 m/s crosswind coming from the east, a longer launch rail (4.0 m) is chosen. This provides the rocket with a longer period to transition from rail-guided to free flight and minimizes initial horizontal deviation.\n   \u2022 The rail\u2019s inclination is kept at 90\u00b0 for a vertical launch.\n   \u2022 Since the wind is coming from the east, I set the launch heading to 90\u00b0 (eastward). In effect, blowing from east tends to push the rocket west; a launch heading east can help counter this drift, aiming to reduce the net horizontal offset at landing.\n\n6. Payload:\n   \u2022 Keeping the payload modest (0.3 kg) helps to keep the overall cost low and mass centered. I set its position at 0.5 m from the rocket\u2019s center which should help maintain balance without compromising the stability envelope.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal configuration in Python dictionary format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```python\nconfig = {\n    \"motor_choice\": \"CesaroniO5800\",\n    \"rocket_body\": {\n        \"radius\": 0.17,               # in meters; must be > motor radius (0.15 m)\n        \"length\": 2.8,                # overall body length in meters\n        \"material\": \"composite\",      # chosen for a good strength-to-weight ratio\n        \"thickness\": 0.009,           # wall thickness in meters for extra structural integrity\n    },\n    \"aerodynamics\": {\n        \"nose_cone\": {\n            \"kind\": \"ogive\",          # low-drag aerodynamic shape\n            \"length\": 0.7,            # nose cone length in meters for smooth transition\n            \"material\": \"fiberglass\", # light and smooth finish for reduced drag\n        },\n        \"fins\": {\n            \"number\": 4,\n            \"root_chord\": 0.20,       # in meters for adequate lift at fin base\n            \"tip_chord\": 0.10,        # in meters for proper tapering\n            \"span\": 0.30,             # fin span in meters for control authority\n            \"cant_angle\": 1,          # slight cant (in degrees) to help damp yaw oscillations\n            \"material\": \"carbon_fiber\", \n            \"thickness\": 0.005,       # fin thickness in meters\n        },\n        \"tail\": {\n            \"length\": 0.5,            # tail length in meters for stability\n            \"top_radius\": 0.04,         # top radius in meters (different from bottom)\n            \"bottom_radius\": 0.06,      # bottom radius in meters to satisfy design check\n            \"material\": \"carbon_fiber\",\n        },\n    },\n    \"parachutes\": {\n        \"main\": {\n            \"name\": \"Main\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.4,            # increased area for strong deceleration\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n        \"drogue\": {\n            \"name\": \"Drogue\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.3,            # secondary chute for early drag before main deployment\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n    },\n    \"launch\": {\n        \"rail_length\": 4.0,         # longer rail length to help mitigate crosswind effects\n        \"inclination\": 90,          # vertical launch (90\u00b0)\n        \"heading\": 90,              # launch heading set to east (90\u00b0) to counteract wind from east\n    },\n    \"payload\": { \n        \"mass\": 0.3,              # payload mass in kg (kept low for cost efficiency)\n        \"position\": 0.5,          # payload position relative to rocket center in meters\n    },\n}\n```\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nThis improved design uses the high-impulse CesaroniO5800 motor while refining the fuselage dimensions and aerodynamic surfaces for a stable and cost\u2010efficient flight.

Objective \u2013 Reaching an apogee of 3048 m  \n\u2002\u2002Our previous flights with the high\u2010impulse \u201cCesaroniO5800\u201d motor were falling short (\u22481920 m) when extra mass and drag lowered the net altitude. To push the design closer to the 3048 m target we must both maximize the effective impulse and minimize unnecessary mass and drag. We accomplish this by trimming overall dimensions, reducing wall thickness and payload mass while still keeping the structure robust.\n\n2. Motor Selection  \n\u2002\u2002We continue to use the \u201cCesaroniO5800\u201d motor because of its high total impulse (\u224830382.7 Ns) and relatively low mass (\u224812.4 kg). Its stated radius is 150 mm (0.15 m), so every other component must have dimensions slightly larger than that (and we will choose 0.17 m for the body radius).\n\n3. Rocket Body  \n\u2002\u2002\u2022 We choose a body radius of 0.17 m\u2014just enough above the motor radius for proper clearance, which minimizes frontal area (reducing drag).  \n\u2002\u2002\u2022 The overall body length is reduced to 2.4 m (down from previous 2.8\u20133.0 m designs) so that the rocket is lean and lower in weight, yet still long enough to house the motor, recovery system and aerodynamic surfaces.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2022 We keep the strong \u201ccomposite\u201d for the body for its proven strength/weight benefits while reducing wall thickness slightly to 0.007 m (from earlier 0.008\u20130.009 m) in order to lower mass and cost.\n\n4. Aerodynamics  \n\u2002\u2002a. Nose Cone \u2013 We use an \u201cogive\u201d nose cone with a 0.5 m length. A shorter but smooth ogive minimizes drag while still providing a gradual transition along the body. \u201cfiberglass\u201d is chosen because of its smooth finish and light weight.  \n\u2002\u2002b. Fins \u2013 To trim weight and drag we opt for 3 fins rather than 4. Their dimensions are scaled down:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Root chord: 0.18 m and tip chord: 0.09 m (for proper tapering), with a span of 0.25 m.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 A very small cant angle of 0.5\u00b0 helps with damping without adding extra side force.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u201cABS_plastic\u201d is chosen for fins: this material is cost\u2010effective and provides sufficient stiffness while keeping mass lower than heavier composites. The thickness is set to 0.004 m.\n\u2002\u2002c. Tail \u2013 For additional stability a small fin\u2010like tail is used. With a 0.3 m length and radii of 0.03 m (top) and 0.05 m (bottom) the design meets the tolerances (radii not equal) while keeping extra drag low. \u201cABS_plastic\u201d is again used here to be consistent with the lightweight fin design.\n\n5. Parachute Recovery System  \n\u2002\u2002Safe recovery is critical. We slightly increase the effective drag area of the main parachute (cd_s = 0.45) to target a landing impact of less than 5 m/s. The drogue remains at cd_s = 0.3 to provide an early drag boost. Both are set to trigger at apogee (sampling_rate = 105 Hz, lag = 1.5 s, noise = (0, 8.3, 0.5)).\n\n6. Launch Rail and Wind Mitigation  \n\u2002\u2002The wind is 5 m/s coming from the east. To help the rocket ride out crosswind effects before free flight, we choose a slightly longer rail (4.0 m). An inclination of 90\u00b0 (vertical launch) paired with a rail heading of 90\u00b0 (east) is chosen as a countermeasure against the wind\u2019s push which tends to shift the flight path laterally.\n\n7. Payload  \n\u2002\u2002Finally, we reduce the payload mass to 0.2 kg (down from 0.3\u20130.5 kg in previous attempts) and place it at 0.4 m from the center. This decreases overall mass, improving the mass ratio and thus helping to achieve a higher apogee.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal configuration in Python dictionary format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nconfig = {\n    \"motor_choice\": \"CesaroniO5800\",  # High impulse motor for reaching high apogee\n    \"rocket_body\": {\n        \"radius\": 0.17,               # in meters; must be > motor radius (0.15 m)\n        \"length\": 2.4,                # overall body length is trimmed to reduce mass and drag\n        \"material\": \"composite\",      # provides a high strength-to-weight ratio\n        \"thickness\": 0.007,           # slightly reduced wall thickness to save weight and cost\n    },\n    \"aerodynamics\": {\n        \"nose_cone\": {\n            \"kind\": \"ogive\",          # low-drag, streamlined shape\n            \"length\": 0.5,            # shorter nose cone reduces drag while ensuring smooth flow\n            \"material\": \"fiberglass\", # light with a smooth finish\n        },\n        \"fins\": {\n            \"number\": 3,              # three fins reduce weight and drag compared to four\n            \"root_chord\": 0.18,       # provides adequate lift at the base of the fin\n            \"tip_chord\": 0.09,        # tapers to minimize drag\n            \"span\": 0.25,             # fin span chosen for adequate control authority\n            \"cant_angle\": 0.5,        # very slight cant to help damp yaw oscillations\n            \"material\": \"ABS_plastic\",# cost-effective and lightweight\n            \"thickness\": 0.004,       # fin thickness in meters\n        },\n        \"tail\": {\n            \"length\": 0.3,            # tail length for additional stability\n            \"top_radius\": 0.03,         # top radius in meters (different from bottom)\n            \"bottom_radius\": 0.05,      # bottom radius in meters to satisfy design checks\n            \"material\": \"ABS_plastic\",  # selected to be lightweight and cost-effective\n        },\n    },\n    \"parachutes\": {\n        \"main\": {\n            \"name\": \"Main\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.45,             # larger area for stronger deceleration\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n        \"drogue\": {\n            \"name\": \"Drogue\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.3,              # drogue chute for early drag\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n    },\n    \"launch\": {\n        \"rail_length\": 4.0,           # increased rail length to help counteract crosswinds\n        \"inclination\": 90,            # vertical launch (90\u00b0)\n        \"heading\": 90,                # rail heading set to 90\u00b0 to help offset an east wind\n    },\n    \"payload\": { \n        \"mass\": 0.2,                # reduced payload mass to improve the mass ratio\n        \"position\": 0.4,            # payload positioned closer to the center for better stability\n    },\n}\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nThis design reduces overall mass and drag (by trimming fuselage length and wall thickness, and lowering payload weight) while keeping the aerodynamic surfaces effective and ensuring robust recovery.

Motor Selection:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 To meet the 3048\u2010m apogee target the motor must provide a very high total impulse. Even though the \u201cCesaroniO5800\u201d is heavy (\u224812.4\u202fkg), its \u224830382.7 Ns impulse is nearly unmatched in our list. We therefore continue with it.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Its stated motor radius is 0.15 m so every fuselage dimension must exceed that.\n\n2. Rocket Body:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 To minimize overall mass and drag while still providing structural integrity, the body radius is set to 0.17 m. This leaves a small clearance over the motor.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The body length is trimmed further (to 2.2 m) versus past designs in order to lower mass and reduce drag.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 We choose \u201ccomposite\u201d for the body since it gives high strength while still keeping weight low.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The wall thickness is reduced to 0.006 m compared to earlier 0.007\u20130.009 m values. This saves mass (and cost) while still remaining robust for the high thrust loads.\n\n3. Aerodynamics:\n\u2003\u2003a. Nose Cone:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 An \u201cogive\u201d shaped nose cone of length 0.5 m is selected to provide a smooth, low\u2010drag transition.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u201cfiberglass\u201d is used for its light weight and smooth finish.\n\u2003\u2003b. Fins:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 To save mass and drag we switch to a three-fin design.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 The fin dimensions are reduced: a root chord of 0.15 m, tip chord of 0.075 m, and a span of 0.2 m. A very slight cant angle (0.5\u00b0) provides damping of yaw without excessive side forces.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u201cABS_plastic\u201d is chosen for the fins because it is both cost-effective and light.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 The fin thickness is reduced to 0.003 m.\n\u2003\u2003c. Tail:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 A small tail (separate from the fins) is provided for added stability. A tail length of 0.2 m is chosen.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 To clear the design check, the tail\u2019s top and bottom radii are set to 0.025 m and 0.035 m, respectively.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u201cABS_plastic\u201d is again used here to save cost and weight.\n\n4. Parachute Recovery System:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 To guarantee that landing impact speeds remain well below 5 m/s, the main parachute\u2019s effective drag area is increased to cd_s = 0.5. The drogue remains at cd_s = 0.3.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Both parachutes are triggered at apogee with a sampling rate of 105 Hz, a lag of 1.5 s, and with a noise tuple of (0, 8.3, 0.5).\n\n5. Launch Rail and Wind Compensation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 With a 5 m/s crosswind coming from the east, an even longer launch rail (4.5 m) is used so that the rocket spends more time under rail guidance before free flight.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The rail\u2019s inclination of 90\u00b0 (vertical) is maintained.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 To counteract wind-induced drift, the launch heading is set to 90\u00b0 (i.e. toward the east). The idea is that a slight imposed bias in the initial thrust direction may help cancel the net wind effect.\n\n6. Payload:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In order to optimize the mass ratio, the payload mass is reduced as far as practical to 0.1 kg.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Its position is kept at 0.3 m from the rocket\u2019s center so as not to disturb the overall stability.\n\nThis revised design minimizes structural and aerodynamic drag while keeping costs down (using lower\u2010cost ABS_plastic for fins and tail) and reducing total weight \u2013 all essential tweaks to push the actual apogee toward the 3048 m target while safely decelerating for landing.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal configuration in Python dictionary format:\n\nconfig = {\n    \"motor_choice\": \"CesaroniO5800\",\n    \"rocket_body\": {\n        \"radius\": 0.17,               # in meters; must be greater than motor radius (0.15 m)\n        \"length\": 2.2,                # overall body length trimmed to reduce mass and drag\n        \"material\": \"composite\",      # high strength-to-weight for structural integrity\n        \"thickness\": 0.006,           # reduced wall thickness for mass and cost savings\n    },\n    \"aerodynamics\": {\n        \"nose_cone\": {\n            \"kind\": \"ogive\",          # low-drag aerodynamic shape\n            \"length\": 0.5,            # smooth transition with a short nose cone\n            \"material\": \"fiberglass\", # light and smooth finish for reduced drag\n        },\n        \"fins\": {\n            \"number\": 3,              # three fins to lower mass and drag\n            \"root_chord\": 0.15,       # in meters for sufficient lift at the base\n            \"tip_chord\": 0.075,       # in meters to taper the fin and minimize drag\n            \"span\": 0.2,              # fin span in meters\n            \"cant_angle\": 0.5,        # slight cant angle (in degrees) to damp yaw\n            \"material\": \"ABS_plastic\",# cost-effective and lightweight\n            \"thickness\": 0.003,       # thin fins to further reduce drag and mass\n        },\n        \"tail\": {\n            \"length\": 0.2,            # tail length for added stability\n            \"top_radius\": 0.025,        # top radius in meters (ensuring it\u2019s different than bottom)\n            \"bottom_radius\": 0.035,     # bottom radius in meters\n            \"material\": \"ABS_plastic\",  # lightweight and low cost\n        },\n    },\n    \"parachutes\": {\n        \"main\": {\n            \"name\": \"Main\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.5,              # larger area for stronger deceleration, ensuring landing impact < 5 m/s\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n        \"drogue\": {\n            \"name\": \"Drogue\",\n            \"cd_s\": 0.3,              # drogue chute to provide early drag\n            \"trigger\": \"apogee\",\n            \"sampling_rate\": 105,\n            \"lag\": 1.5,\n            \"noise\": (0, 8.3, 0.5),\n        },\n    },\n    \"launch\": {\n        \"rail_length\": 4.5,           # longer rail to help counteract the 5 m/s eastward crosswind\n        \"inclination\": 90,            # vertical launch (90\u00b0)\n        \"heading\": 90,                # launch heading set east (90\u00b0) to help offset wind drift\n    },\n    \"payload\": { \n        \"mass\": 0.1,                # reduced payload mass for improved mass ratio\n        \"position\": 0.3,            # payload positioned near the center for better stability\n    },\n}\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nThis configuration has been tuned to reduce overall mass and drag while using a high\u2010impulse motor.
