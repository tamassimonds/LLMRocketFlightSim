Below is the full reasoning behind our improved design followed by the final configuration dictionary.

──────────────────────────────
Reasoning:

1. Motor Selection:
   • To reach an apogee of 3048 m, we need a motor with high total impulse. The “CesaroniO5800” offers roughly 30,382.7 Ns of impulse with an average thrust of 5040.2 N, which is well suited for our target.
   • Its stated radius is 150 mm (0.15 m). That means our rocket’s body radius must exceed 0.15 m.

2. Rocket Body:
   • We choose a body radius of 0.17 m—large enough to clear the motor and allow internal components without excessive mass.
   • A slightly longer body (3.0 m overall length) gives more internal volume while helping with aerodynamic stability and reducing cost through simpler construction.
   • The material selected is “composite” because it provides a good strength‐to‐weight ratio at a reasonable cost.
   • A wall thickness of 0.008 m is chosen to keep the structure both strong and cost effective.

3. Nose Cone:
   • The “ogive” shape is chosen for its low drag characteristics.
   • A nose cone length of 0.6 m offers a smooth transition, reducing aerodynamic disturbances.
   • “fiberglass” is used as it is light, strong, and available in our materials list.

4. Fin and Tail Design:
   • For stability, we use 4 fins.
   • The fins have a root chord of 0.25 m and a tip chord of 0.125 m. The span is set to 0.3 m, enough to provide the desired aerodynamic control.
   • A cant angle of 3° is added to optimize airflow and improve yaw stability.
   • “carbon_fiber” is selected for the fins to ensure rigidity without an excessive mass penalty. The fin thickness is 0.005 m.
   • For the tail, we use a short, fin-like structure with a length of 0.4 m.
   • To satisfy the design check that the tail’s top and bottom radii differ, we set the top radius to 0.05 m and bottom radius to 0.07 m.
   • The tail material is also “carbon_fiber” to maintain strength and consistency with the fins.

5. Parachute Recovery System:
   • For the main chute, a slightly larger effective area is chosen (cd_s = 0.35) to ensure that the rocket decelerates sufficiently for a safe landing (target landing speed < 5 m/s).
   • The drogue parachute uses a cd_s value of 0.25, giving an early drag boost as it comes out upon reaching apogee.
   • Both are triggered at apogee with a sampling rate set to 105 Hz, a lag of 1.5 s, and the same noise tuple (0, 8.3, 0.5).

6. Launch Rail Configuration:
   • A rail length of 3.5 m provides a good balance: long enough to stabilize the rocket against a 5 m/s crosswind from the east but not so long as to add unnecessary cost.
   • An inclination of 90° is used to ensure a vertical launch and counteract lateral drift.
   • The heading is set to 0° (i.e. straight upward) to keep the initial ascent as vertical as possible.

7. Payload:
   • A payload mass of 0.3 kg is assumed. Its position is set 0.6 m from the rocket’s center to keep the mass near the middle for optimal stability.

This design makes a balanced compromise between cost, safety, and performance. It uses a high-impulse motor to reach the desired apogee while the aerodynamic and stability components have been sized and configured to overcome moderate wind conditions, maintain stability, and ensure a survivable landing speed.
