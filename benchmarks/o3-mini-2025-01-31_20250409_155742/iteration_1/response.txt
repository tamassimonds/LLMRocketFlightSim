Below is my reasoning followed by the design configuration.

──────────────────────────────
Reasoning:

1. Motor Selection:
   • We need a motor that can produce enough impulse to push our rocket to roughly 3048 m (10,000 ft). Looking at the available motors, the “CesaroniO5800” provides a total impulse of roughly 30,382 Ns with an average thrust around 5040 N and a burn time of 5.2 s. This gives us a good thrust‐to‐weight ratio while keeping the mass moderate.
   • Its motor radius is given as 150 mm. Therefore, the rocket body must have a radius greater than 0.15 m.

2. Body Design:
   • Chose a body radius slightly larger than the motor radius (0.18 m) for ample internal room and structural margin.
   • A body length of about 2.5 m was chosen to accommodate the propulsion, recovery, and aerodynamic components yet remain as lightweight as possible.
   • A strong yet cost‐efficient material is “composite” which offers high strength-to-weight and is available.
   • A wall thickness of 0.008 m is chosen to minimize cost and mass while keeping structural integrity.

3. Aerodynamics – Nose Cone, Fins, and Tail:
   • Nose Cone: A classic “ogive” shape is chosen with a length of 0.5 m. “Fiberglass” is used for its good strength, smooth finish, and light weight.
   • Fins: With 4 fins, dimensions were selected for stability. The root chord (0.2 m) and tip chord (0.1 m) and a span of 0.25 m provide enough area for aerodynamic control. A small cant angle (2°) is included for improved stability. “Carbon_fiber” is selected for its light weight and stiffness with 0.005 m thickness.
   • Tail: A fin-like tail structure is included to ensure control. The tail length is set to 0.3 m. Keeping the design within the simulation checks, the top radius is set at 0.04 m and the bottom radius at 0.06 m (note these are not equal as required). “Carbon_fiber” is again chosen for consistency and strength.

4. Parachute Recovery System:
   • Both a main and a drogue chute are specified. For a safe landing (impact speed < 5 m/s) the main parachute area is picked slightly larger (cd_s = 0.3) compared to the drogue (cd_s = 0.2) so that after apogee the rocket decelerates sufficiently.
   • Both parachutes are triggered at apogee (as per the simulation requirements), with a sampling rate of 105 Hz, a lag time of 1.5 s and a noise tuple representative of the deployment dynamics.

5. Launch Rail:
   • A rail length of 3.0 m is chosen. Longer rails give the rocket time to align and help counteract a 5 m/s crosswind by providing a stable initial ascent.
   • The inclination is set at 90° (for a vertical launch) and the heading remains 0° (since wind from the east will shift the trajectory slightly, but the recovery system and guidance will handle the offset).

6. Payload:
   • A modest payload of 0.5 kg is assumed and it is placed half a meter from the rocket’s center so that its mass is contained within the stability envelope.

All design choices have been checked against the simulation constraints:
   • The motor and body dimensions agree (body radius > motor radius).
   • The aerodynamic tail satisfies the condition that top and bottom radii differ.
   • The choice of materials uses only those available.
   • The parachutes and rail settings are chosen to help safe recovery even in moderate cross-winds.
