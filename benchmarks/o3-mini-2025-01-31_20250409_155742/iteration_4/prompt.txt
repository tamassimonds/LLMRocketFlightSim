# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

Before answering you should provide your full reasoning for the design choices you made thinking like a rocket scientist. Run sample calulations, make approximations etc to find best design



=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ===

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
Below is my reasoning followed by the design configuration.

──────────────────────────────
Reasoning:

1. Motor Selection:
   • We need a motor that can produce enough impulse to push our rocket to roughly 3048 m (10,000 ft). Looking at the available motors, the “CesaroniO5800” provides a total impulse of roughly 30,382 Ns with an average thrust around 5040 N and a burn time of 5.2 s. This gives us a good thrust‐to‐weight ratio while keeping the mass moderate.
   • Its motor radius is given as 150 mm. Therefore, the rocket body must have a radius greater than 0.15 m.

2. Body Design:
   • Chose a body radius slightly larger than the motor radius (0.18 m) for ample internal room and structural margin.
   • A body length of about 2.5 m was chosen to accommodate the propulsion, recovery, and aerodynamic components yet remain as lightweight as possible.
   • A strong yet cost‐efficient material is “composite” which offers high strength-to-weight and is available.
   • A wall thickness of 0.008 m is chosen to minimize cost and mass while keeping structural integrity.

3. Aerodynamics – Nose Cone, Fins, and Tail:
   • Nose Cone: A classic “ogive” shape is chosen with a length of 0.5 m. “Fiberglass” is used for its good strength, smooth finish, and light weight.
   • Fins: With 4 fins, dimensions were selected for stability. The root chord (0.2 m) and tip chord (0.1 m) and a span of 0.25 m provide enough area for aerodynamic control. A small cant angle (2°) is included for improved stability. “Carbon_fiber” is selected for its light weight and stiffness with 0.005 m thickness.
   • Tail: A fin-like tail structure is included to ensure control. The tail length is set to 0.3 m. Keeping the design within the simulation checks, the top radius is set at 0.04 m and the bottom radius at 0.06 m (note these are not equal as required). “Carbon_fiber” is again chosen for consistency and strength.

4. Parachute Recovery System:
   • Both a main and a drogue chute are specified. For a safe landing (impact speed < 5 m/s) the main parachute area is picked slightly larger (cd_s = 0.3) compared to the drogue (cd_s = 0.2) so that after apogee the rocket decelerates sufficiently.
   • Both parachutes are triggered at apogee (as per the simulation requirements), with a sampling rate of 105 Hz, a lag time of 1.5 s and a noise tuple representative of the deployment dynamics.

5. Launch Rail:
   • A rail length of 3.0 m is chosen. Longer rails give the rocket time to align and help counteract a 5 m/s crosswind by providing a stable initial ascent.
   • The inclination is set at 90° (for a vertical launch) and the heading remains 0° (since wind from the east will shift the trajectory slightly, but the recovery system and guidance will handle the offset).

6. Payload:
   • A modest payload of 0.5 kg is assumed and it is placed half a meter from the rocket’s center so that its mass is contained within the stability envelope.

All design choices have been checked against the simulation constraints:
   • The motor and body dimensions agree (body radius > motor radius).
   • The aerodynamic tail satisfies the condition that top and bottom radii differ.
   • The choice of materials uses only those available.
   • The parachutes and rail settings are chosen to help safe recovery even in moderate cross-winds.

Score: 0.00/100

--- ATTEMPT 2 ---
Design:
Below is the full reasoning behind our improved design followed by the final configuration dictionary.

──────────────────────────────
Reasoning:

1. Motor Selection:
   • To reach an apogee of 3048 m, we need a motor with high total impulse. The “CesaroniO5800” offers roughly 30,382.7 Ns of impulse with an average thrust of 5040.2 N, which is well suited for our target.
   • Its stated radius is 150 mm (0.15 m). That means our rocket’s body radius must exceed 0.15 m.

2. Rocket Body:
   • We choose a body radius of 0.17 m—large enough to clear the motor and allow internal components without excessive mass.
   • A slightly longer body (3.0 m overall length) gives more internal volume while helping with aerodynamic stability and reducing cost through simpler construction.
   • The material selected is “composite” because it provides a good strength‐to‐weight ratio at a reasonable cost.
   • A wall thickness of 0.008 m is chosen to keep the structure both strong and cost effective.

3. Nose Cone:
   • The “ogive” shape is chosen for its low drag characteristics.
   • A nose cone length of 0.6 m offers a smooth transition, reducing aerodynamic disturbances.
   • “fiberglass” is used as it is light, strong, and available in our materials list.

4. Fin and Tail Design:
   • For stability, we use 4 fins.
   • The fins have a root chord of 0.25 m and a tip chord of 0.125 m. The span is set to 0.3 m, enough to provide the desired aerodynamic control.
   • A cant angle of 3° is added to optimize airflow and improve yaw stability.
   • “carbon_fiber” is selected for the fins to ensure rigidity without an excessive mass penalty. The fin thickness is 0.005 m.
   • For the tail, we use a short, fin-like structure with a length of 0.4 m.
   • To satisfy the design check that the tail’s top and bottom radii differ, we set the top radius to 0.05 m and bottom radius to 0.07 m.
   • The tail material is also “carbon_fiber” to maintain strength and consistency with the fins.

5. Parachute Recovery System:
   • For the main chute, a slightly larger effective area is chosen (cd_s = 0.35) to ensure that the rocket decelerates sufficiently for a safe landing (target landing speed < 5 m/s).
   • The drogue parachute uses a cd_s value of 0.25, giving an early drag boost as it comes out upon reaching apogee.
   • Both are triggered at apogee with a sampling rate set to 105 Hz, a lag of 1.5 s, and the same noise tuple (0, 8.3, 0.5).

6. Launch Rail Configuration:
   • A rail length of 3.5 m provides a good balance: long enough to stabilize the rocket against a 5 m/s crosswind from the east but not so long as to add unnecessary cost.
   • An inclination of 90° is used to ensure a vertical launch and counteract lateral drift.
   • The heading is set to 0° (i.e. straight upward) to keep the initial ascent as vertical as possible.

7. Payload:
   • A payload mass of 0.3 kg is assumed. Its position is set 0.6 m from the rocket’s center to keep the mass near the middle for optimal stability.

Below is my detailed reasoning followed by the final Python‐formatted configuration.

──────────────────────────────
Reasoning:

1. Motor Selection:
   • To reach a 3048‑meter apogee, we need ample total impulse. Although there are several motor options, the “CesaroniO5800” (impulse ≈ 30382.7 Ns, avg thrust ≈5040 N over 5.2 s, and a dry mass of 12.418 kg) gives us the power necessary for the high altitude.
   • Its motor radius is 150 mm (0.15 m), so our rocket body must have a radius larger than that.

2. Rocket Body:
   • To minimize cost (and mass) while keeping structural integrity, I’ve chosen a body radius of 0.17 m – just enough clearance above the motor.
   • The body length is set to 2.8 m. This is long enough to house the motor, recovery system and provide aerodynamic stability without unnecessarily adding mass.
   • Material “composite” is used because it offers a good strength‐to‐weight ratio. (Although sometimes more expensive, safety is paramount to avoid structural failure.)
   • I’ve increased the wall thickness slightly to 0.009 m compared to previous attempts to ensure the structure can comfortably handle the heavy motor and high thrust loads.

3. Aerodynamics:
   a. Nose Cone:
      • An “ogive” shape is known for low drag. I’ve lengthened the nose cone to 0.7 m for a smooth transition and to improve aerodynamic performance.
      • “fiberglass” is used for the nose cone because of its smooth finish and light weight.
   
   b. Fins:
      • Four fins are included for enhanced stability. Their dimensions are chosen to provide sufficient control while keeping them light.
      • I use a root chord of 0.20 m and tip chord of 0.10 m with a span of 0.30 m. A very slight cant angle of 1° is added so that any small yaw perturbations are damped while not producing excessive side forces.
      • “carbon_fiber” is selected for the fins due to its high stiffness and light weight; the thickness is 0.005 m.
   
   c. Tail:
      • The tail (separate from the fins) is designed with a length of 0.5 m.
      • To satisfy the simulation check that the top and bottom radii differ, I’ve chosen a top radius of 0.04 m and a bottom radius of 0.06 m.
      • “carbon_fiber” is again used for the tail for consistency and strength.

4. Parachute Recovery System:
   • For a safe landing (impact speed under 5 m/s) and to minimize horizontal drift, the main parachute is given a larger effective drag (cd_s = 0.4). The drogue chute is sized slightly smaller (cd_s = 0.3) so that it provides early drag while the main chute ensures a gentle touchdown.
   • Both chutes deploy at apogee (trigger set to “apogee”), with a sampling rate of 105 Hz, a deployment lag of 1.5 s, and a noise tuple of (0, 8.3, 0.5).

5. Launch Rail Configuration:
   • To help counter the 5 m/s crosswind coming from the east, a longer launch rail (4.0 m) is chosen. This provides the rocket with a longer period to transition from rail-guided to free flight and minimizes initial horizontal deviation.
   • The rail’s inclination is kept at 90° for a vertical launch.
   • Since the wind is coming from the east, I set the launch heading to 90° (eastward). In effect, blowing from east tends to push the rocket west; a launch heading east can help counter this drift, aiming to reduce the net horizontal offset at landing.

6. Payload:
   • Keeping the payload modest (0.3 kg) helps to keep the overall cost low and mass centered. I set its position at 0.5 m from the rocket’s center which should help maintain balance without compromising the stability envelope.

This improved design uses the high-impulse CesaroniO5800 motor while refining the fuselage dimensions and aerodynamic surfaces for a stable and cost‐efficient flight. The extended rail and adjusted heading are intended to counteract a 5 m/s east wind, helping the rocket land as close as possible to the launch site and ensuring a safe landing speed.
