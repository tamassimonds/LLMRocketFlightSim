Below is my reasoning for an improved design followed by the final configuration dictionary.

──────────────────────────────
Reasoning:

1. Motor Selection:
  • To meet the 3048‐m apogee target the motor must provide a very high total impulse. Even though the “CesaroniO5800” is heavy (≈12.4 kg), its ≈30382.7 Ns impulse is nearly unmatched in our list. We therefore continue with it.
  • Its stated motor radius is 0.15 m so every fuselage dimension must exceed that.

2. Rocket Body:
  • To minimize overall mass and drag while still providing structural integrity, the body radius is set to 0.17 m. This leaves a small clearance over the motor.
  • The body length is trimmed further (to 2.2 m) versus past designs in order to lower mass and reduce drag.
  • We choose “composite” for the body since it gives high strength while still keeping weight low.
  • The wall thickness is reduced to 0.006 m compared to earlier 0.007–0.009 m values. This saves mass (and cost) while still remaining robust for the high thrust loads.

3. Aerodynamics:
  a. Nose Cone:
    • An “ogive” shaped nose cone of length 0.5 m is selected to provide a smooth, low‐drag transition.
    • “fiberglass” is used for its light weight and smooth finish.
  b. Fins:
    • To save mass and drag we switch to a three-fin design.
    • The fin dimensions are reduced: a root chord of 0.15 m, tip chord of 0.075 m, and a span of 0.2 m. A very slight cant angle (0.5°) provides damping of yaw without excessive side forces.
    • “ABS_plastic” is chosen for the fins because it is both cost-effective and light.
    • The fin thickness is reduced to 0.003 m.
  c. Tail:
    • A small tail (separate from the fins) is provided for added stability. A tail length of 0.2 m is chosen.
    • To clear the design check, the tail’s top and bottom radii are set to 0.025 m and 0.035 m, respectively.
    • “ABS_plastic” is again used here to save cost and weight.

4. Parachute Recovery System:
  • To guarantee that landing impact speeds remain well below 5 m/s, the main parachute’s effective drag area is increased to cd_s = 0.5. The drogue remains at cd_s = 0.3.
  • Both parachutes are triggered at apogee with a sampling rate of 105 Hz, a lag of 1.5 s, and with a noise tuple of (0, 8.3, 0.5).

5. Launch Rail and Wind Compensation:
  • With a 5 m/s crosswind coming from the east, an even longer launch rail (4.5 m) is used so that the rocket spends more time under rail guidance before free flight.
  • The rail’s inclination of 90° (vertical) is maintained.
  • To counteract wind-induced drift, the launch heading is set to 90° (i.e. toward the east). The idea is that a slight imposed bias in the initial thrust direction may help cancel the net wind effect.

6. Payload:
  • In order to optimize the mass ratio, the payload mass is reduced as far as practical to 0.1 kg.
  • Its position is kept at 0.3 m from the rocket’s center so as not to disturb the overall stability.

This revised design minimizes structural and aerodynamic drag while keeping costs down (using lower‐cost ABS_plastic for fins and tail) and reducing total weight – all essential tweaks to push the actual apogee toward the 3048 m target while safely decelerating for landing.

This configuration has been tuned to reduce overall mass and drag while using a high‐impulse motor. The reduced body length and wall thickness, lower payload mass, and cheaper ABS_plastic fins/tail are aimed at pushing the apogee near 3048 m, improving cost reward, and ensuring safe, low‐impact recovery against a 5 m/s east wind.
