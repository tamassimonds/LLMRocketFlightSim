Below is my detailed reasoning followed by the final Python‐formatted configuration.

──────────────────────────────
Reasoning:

1. Motor Selection:
   • To reach a 3048‑meter apogee, we need ample total impulse. Although there are several motor options, the “CesaroniO5800” (impulse ≈ 30382.7 Ns, avg thrust ≈5040 N over 5.2 s, and a dry mass of 12.418 kg) gives us the power necessary for the high altitude.
   • Its motor radius is 150 mm (0.15 m), so our rocket body must have a radius larger than that.

2. Rocket Body:
   • To minimize cost (and mass) while keeping structural integrity, I’ve chosen a body radius of 0.17 m – just enough clearance above the motor.
   • The body length is set to 2.8 m. This is long enough to house the motor, recovery system and provide aerodynamic stability without unnecessarily adding mass.
   • Material “composite” is used because it offers a good strength‐to‐weight ratio. (Although sometimes more expensive, safety is paramount to avoid structural failure.)
   • I’ve increased the wall thickness slightly to 0.009 m compared to previous attempts to ensure the structure can comfortably handle the heavy motor and high thrust loads.

3. Aerodynamics:
   a. Nose Cone:
      • An “ogive” shape is known for low drag. I’ve lengthened the nose cone to 0.7 m for a smooth transition and to improve aerodynamic performance.
      • “fiberglass” is used for the nose cone because of its smooth finish and light weight.
   
   b. Fins:
      • Four fins are included for enhanced stability. Their dimensions are chosen to provide sufficient control while keeping them light.
      • I use a root chord of 0.20 m and tip chord of 0.10 m with a span of 0.30 m. A very slight cant angle of 1° is added so that any small yaw perturbations are damped while not producing excessive side forces.
      • “carbon_fiber” is selected for the fins due to its high stiffness and light weight; the thickness is 0.005 m.
   
   c. Tail:
      • The tail (separate from the fins) is designed with a length of 0.5 m.
      • To satisfy the simulation check that the top and bottom radii differ, I’ve chosen a top radius of 0.04 m and a bottom radius of 0.06 m.
      • “carbon_fiber” is again used for the tail for consistency and strength.

4. Parachute Recovery System:
   • For a safe landing (impact speed under 5 m/s) and to minimize horizontal drift, the main parachute is given a larger effective drag (cd_s = 0.4). The drogue chute is sized slightly smaller (cd_s = 0.3) so that it provides early drag while the main chute ensures a gentle touchdown.
   • Both chutes deploy at apogee (trigger set to “apogee”), with a sampling rate of 105 Hz, a deployment lag of 1.5 s, and a noise tuple of (0, 8.3, 0.5).

5. Launch Rail Configuration:
   • To help counter the 5 m/s crosswind coming from the east, a longer launch rail (4.0 m) is chosen. This provides the rocket with a longer period to transition from rail-guided to free flight and minimizes initial horizontal deviation.
   • The rail’s inclination is kept at 90° for a vertical launch.
   • Since the wind is coming from the east, I set the launch heading to 90° (eastward). In effect, blowing from east tends to push the rocket west; a launch heading east can help counter this drift, aiming to reduce the net horizontal offset at landing.

6. Payload:
   • Keeping the payload modest (0.3 kg) helps to keep the overall cost low and mass centered. I set its position at 0.5 m from the rocket’s center which should help maintain balance without compromising the stability envelope.

This improved design uses the high-impulse CesaroniO5800 motor while refining the fuselage dimensions and aerodynamic surfaces for a stable and cost‐efficient flight. The extended rail and adjusted heading are intended to counteract a 5 m/s east wind, helping the rocket land as close as possible to the launch site and ensuring a safe landing speed.
