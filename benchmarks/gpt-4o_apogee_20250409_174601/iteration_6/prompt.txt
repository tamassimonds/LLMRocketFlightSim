# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Apogee**: 3048.0 meters
- **Wind Conditions**: 20 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
structural_failure = None  # Whether the rocket structure failed during flight
structural_failure_reward = 0

if structural_failure is not None:
    if structural_failure:
        structural_failure_reward = 0
    else:
        # Structural failure did not occur
        structural_failure_reward = 1

# Calculate horizontal distance reward
# Lower horizontal distance from launch site is better
horz_distance = abs(horizontal_distance)  # Distance in meters from launch site
max_horz_distance = target_apogee * 0.3  # Maximum acceptable horizontal distance
horz_distance_reward = max(0, 1 - horz_distance / max_horz_distance)

# Calculate cost reward
# Lower cost designs receive higher rewards
cost = total_cost  # Total cost of rocket components
max_cost = 1000  # Maximum cost threshold
cost_reward = max(0, 1 - cost / max_cost)

# Calculate landing impact velocity reward
# Lower impact velocity (safer landing) is better
impact_velocity = abs(impact_velocity)  # Landing speed in m/s
max_impact_velocity = 50  # Maximum acceptable impact velocity
impact_reward = max(0, 1 - impact_velocity / max_impact_velocity)

percent_difference = abs(apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee
distance_reward = 1.0 - percent_difference
distance_reward = max(0, distance_reward)


# Calculate total reward with component weights
reward = distance_reward + horz_distance_reward * 0.2 + cost_reward * 0.3 + impact_reward * 0.3 + structural_failure_reward * 0.2

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

--- ATTEMPT 1 ---
Design:
To design a rocket that meets the requirements and maximizes the score, we need a detailed understanding of each component and the constraints provided. Let's tackle this systematically: 

### Design Considerations and Strategy

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048 meters with minimal deviation.
2. **Wind Conditions**: 20 m/s from the east, so we should consider the aerodynamic stability and adjust launch heading to potentially counteract drift.
3. **Cost Sensitivity**: Keep costs low to improve the cost reward factor.
4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure impact velocity is less than 5 m/s and minimize structural failure risk.
5. **Components**:
   - **Motor**: Choose based on thrust that can achieve desired apogee.
   - **Material**: Balance between weight, cost, and strength.
   - **Parachute**: Ensure a safe landing velocity.
   - **Aerodynamics**: Minimize drag and optimize for the wind.

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### Step 1: Motor Selection
- **CesaroniK160**: It's a reasonable balance for achieving near-target apogee without excessive costs since it has a relatively high Isp and thrust, but it's designed for longer burns.

#### Step 2: Rocket Body
- **Material**: Use **fiberglass**. It's cost-effective and provides a good balance of strength-to-weight.
- **Dimensions**: 
  - **Radius**: Slightly larger than the motor radius to ensure fitment. Motor radius is 54 mm, so choose 0.08 meters.
  - **Length**: Start with 1.8 meters for the body to accommodate the motor and payload effectively.
  - **Wall Thickness**: 0.005 meters for structural integrity.

#### Step 3: Nose Cone
- **Shape**: Opt for an **ogive shape** for reduced drag, common in atmospheric aerodynamics.
- **Length and Material**: 0.2 meters using **fiberglass**.

#### Step 4: Fins
- **Number & Material**: Use 3 fins made of **carbon_fiber** for aerodynamic stability and minimal weight.
- **Dimensions**:
  - Root Chord: 0.15 meters
  - Tip Chord: 0.075 meters
  - Span: 0.15 meters
  - Cant Angle: 0 degrees for simplicity and minimizing drag
  - Thickness: 0.003 meters

#### Step 5: Tail
- **Material**: Use **carbon_fiber** to ensure strength with lightweight characteristics.
- **Design**: A simple flare for stability, top radius of 0.08 meters and bottom radius of 0.1 meters.
  
#### Step 6: Parachute System
- **Main Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: Design for a descent rate of approximately 4.5 m/s.
  - Area estimation: 0.5 (requires some iteration and testing)
- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: Smaller surface area designed for controlled descent post-apogee, set at 0.15.

#### Step 7: Launch Rail
- **Length**: 5 meters to ensure full velocity stabilization before leaving the rail.
- **Inclination**: Set to 88 degrees, slightly off vertical, accounting for wind drift with a heading towards the wind (180 degrees to counter east wind).

#### Step 8: Payload
- Include a lightweight payload to simulate realistic flight conditions without greatly affecting performance.
- Set mass to 1 kg placed at the center (position: 0.9 meters) adjacent to the rocket's center of gravity.

--- ATTEMPT 2 ---
Design:
In order to improve the rocket design and ensure it reaches the desired apogee of 3048 meters while optimizing cost, safety, and other parameters, we'll need to make some strategic adjustments. Let's address the shortcomings from the last attempt and devise a more suitable design.

### Design Strategy

1. **Motor Selection**: The previous motor choice, **CesaroniK160**, was severely underpowered for achieving the target apogee. We need a motor with higher thrust and total impulse. Given our options, we will explore a more potent motor.
   
2. **Rocket Dimensions and Materials**: To accommodate a larger motor and enhance aerodynamic performance, we'll adjust the dimensions and select suitable materials.

3. **Aerodynamics**: Optimize the nose cone and fin design for reduced drag.

4. **Parachute System**: Ensure parachutes are adequately sized for a safe landing speed.

5. **Cost and Structural Integrity**: Balance the choice of materials to keep costs under control while ensuring structural integrity.

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### Step 1: Motor Selection
- Choose **CesaroniM1670**, which provides a higher average thrust of 1533.9 N and a total impulse of 6023.6 Ns. It’s a significant step up from the previous motor choice, allowing the rocket to achieve a higher apogee.

#### Step 2: Rocket Body
- **Material**: Use **fiberglass** for a balance between affordability and strength.
- **Dimensions**:
  - **Radius**: 0.08 meters (motor radius is 0.075 meters).
  - **Length**: 2.5 meters to house the larger motor while ensuring stability.
  - **Wall Thickness**: 0.005 meters.

#### Step 3: Nose Cone
- **Shape**: Use an **ogive** or **tangent** shape for efficient aerodynamics.
- **Length and Material**: 0.3 meters, using **fiberglass** to minimize weight and cost.

#### Step 4: Fins
- **Number and Material**: Use 3 fins made of **carbon_fiber** to maintain a light yet sturdy framework.
- **Dimensions**:
  - Root Chord: 0.2 meters
  - Tip Chord: 0.1 meters
  - Span: 0.2 meters
  - Cant Angle: 0 degrees for straightforward drag-minimizing design.
  - Thickness: 0.004 meters

#### Step 5: Tail
- **Material**: Use **carbon_fiber** for a strong and light structure.
- **Design**: A flared design for stability; top radius 0.08 meters and bottom radius 0.09 meters.

#### Step 6: Parachute System
- **Main Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: Larger value such as 0.6 to ensure a gentler landing speed.
- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: Adjusted to 0.3 for controlled descent after reaching apogee.

#### Step 7: Launch Rail
- **Length**: 5 meters for ample stabilization during launch.
- **Inclination and Heading**: Set to 88 degrees inclination with a 180-degree heading to counteract the 20 m/s wind from the east.

#### Step 8: Payload
- **Payload mass**: 0.5 kg for a modest additional mass.
- **Position**: Centered at 1.25 meters to balance the rocket.

#### Step 2: Rocket Body
- **Material**: Stick with **fiberglass** for cost-effectiveness and good structural performance.
- **Dimensions**:
  - **Radius**: 0.08 meters to ensure room for the motor (motor radius is 0.075 meters).
  - **Length**: 2.7 meters to house the components securely.
  - **Wall Thickness**: 0.006 meters for added strength and stability.

#### Step 3: Nose Cone
- **Shape and Material**: Utilize an **ogive** shape for minimized drag and effective penetration through the atmosphere.
- **Length**: 0.35 meters, made from **fiberglass** for a good weight balance.

#### Step 4: Fins
- **Number and Material**: Use 3 fins of **carbon_fiber** for lightweight and durable aerodynamic surfaces.
- **Dimensions**:
  - Root Chord: 0.18 meters
  - Tip Chord: 0.08 meters
  - Span: 0.25 meters for increased stability.
  - Cant Angle: 2 degrees to enhance roll stability.
  - Thickness: 0.003 meters

#### Step 5: Tail
- **Design and Material**: Utilize **carbon_fiber** with a flare to balance stability with reduced bottom drag.
- **Dimensions**: A top radius of 0.08 meters tapering to 0.085 meters for minimized drag at the tail.

#### Step 6: Parachute System
- **Main Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: Increase to 0.7 for a gentle descent.
- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: Keep at 0.25 for intermediate descent stability.

#### Step 7: Launch Rail
- **Length**: 6 meters to give additional flight guidance due to wind.
- **Inclination and Heading**: Set to 85 degrees inclination with a 180-degree heading to effectively oppose the 20 m/s wind from the east, ensuring sustained control and altitude gain.

#### Step 8: Payload
- **Mass and Position**: A 0.5 kg payload at the center position of 1.35 meters to balance the rocket's center of gravity and stabilize flight.

Design:
To design a rocket that meets the target apogee while optimizing cost and ensuring safety and structural integrity, we need to identify the issues in the previous attempts. The key challenge seems to be achieving the desired altitude, as the rockets in prior attempts fell significantly short. Our strategy will involve improving motor thrust and adjusting the design for optimal aerodynamics without significantly increasing costs.

### Strategy for Improved Design

1. **Motor Selection**:
   - Prior attempts with the **CesaroniM1670** motor did not reach the target apogee. Therefore, we need a more powerful motor, primarily focusing on higher thrust and total impulse.
   - The **CesaroniO3700** motor seems promising, providing a very high thrust (4030.3 N) and a total impulse of 29930.2 Ns.

2. **Rocket Body**:
   - We will choose lightweight materials to minimize mass while maintaining structural integrity.
   - Increase the rocket size to accommodate a larger motor.

3. **Aerodynamics**:
   - A nose cone shape that reduces drag, such as a Von Kármán shape.
   - Opt for lightweight materials like carbon fiber for fins and body to improve performance.

4. **Parachute System**:
   - Ensure the parachutes enable a gentle landing, reducing impact velocity.

5. **Launch Rail Settings**:
   - Adjust rail inclination and heading to minimize wind effects.

### Calculation Considerations

- The current attempts indicate a priority need for higher thrust motors.
- Estimate required burn time and impulse to reach the target apogee using a simplified physics calculation.
- Consider using lightweight and aerodynamic materials to lower drag.

}
```

### Final Thoughts

This design utilizes the high-thrust **CesaroniO3700** motor, lighter and aerodynamic construction components, and precautions to handle wind effectively. This should maximize the rocket's potential to reach the desired apogee. Adjustments to parachute configuration improve recovery safety, and structural integrity should be maintained with quality materials like carbon fiber. The adjustments balance cost efficiency with performance objectives, primarily focusing on reaching the maximum height safely.

Design:
To improve the rocket design and achieve the target apogee of 3048 meters, we'll need to carefully adjust our approach. The previous attempts either fell short of the target apogee or were not optimized for cost. Analyzing the results, it appears that a more powerful motor and a balanced design focusing on aerodynamics and lightweight materials are needed. Here's how we'll proceed with the revised design:

### Key Considerations

1. **Motor Selection**: 
   - We need a high-thrust motor with sufficient impulse to reach the target apogee. Previous attempts with lower thrust motors consistently fell short.
   - The **CesaroniO5800** motor provides a significant thrust with a total impulse of 30382.7 Ns, which is more than adequate for our target altitude.

2. **Rocket Body**:
   - Use a lightweight but strong structure to maximize the ascent efficiency.
   - Carbon fiber will be used for the main body due to its excellent strength-to-weight ratio.
   - Ensure the body dimensions can accommodate the large motor.

3. **Aerodynamics**:
   - Choose a nose cone shape that minimizes drag.
   - Optimize fin design for stability and control while reducing weight.

4. **Parachute System**:
   - Ensure parachutes are sized correctly to achieve a safe landing speed below 5 m/s.

5. **Launch Rail Configuration**:
   - Adjust the inclination and heading to compensate for wind effects.

### Adjustments and Calculations

- **Motor Power**: The CesaroniO5800 should provide enough thrust to reach and surpass 3048 meters, considering a significant improvement in total impulse over previous attempts.
  
- **Weight and Drag**: Components must be lightweight and aerodynamic to minimize drag during ascent and descent. Using carbon fiber for key structural components can save weight and reduce the overall drag profile.

### Proposed Design

config = {
    "motor_choice": "CesaroniO5800",

### Final Thoughts

This design leverages the high thrust and impulse of the CesaroniO5800 motor, combined with lightweight, aerodynamic components, to reach and ideally exceed the target apogee. The design aims to balance performance, cost, and safety while addressing the shortcomings observed in previous attempts. By fine-tuning the payload position, material choice, and aerodynamic components, the rocket should achieve better efficiency and meet the project goals.
