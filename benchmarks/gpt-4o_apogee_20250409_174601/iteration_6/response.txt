To design a rocket that will meet the target apogee of 3048 meters, we need to review the previous attempts and refine our approach focusing on a balance of thrust, weight, and aerodynamic efficiency, while also considering cost constraints. Here's a revised strategy based on lessons learned:

### Key Considerations

1. **Motor Selection**: The motor needs to have ample thrust to achieve the desired apogee yet provide a controlled ascent without excessive velocity that could lead to structural failure or overshoot.

2. **Weight Management**: Use lightweight materials for a good strength-to-weight ratio and ensure the motor, body, and payload are balanced for a stable flight.

3. **Aerodynamics**: Optimize the nose cone and fins to minimize drag and stabilize the rocket's trajectory.

4. **Parachute Sizing**: Ensure parachutes are appropriately sized to slow descent and achieve safe landing speeds below 5 m/s.

5. **Launch Configuration**: Adjust launch rail inclination and heading to counteract wind effects and maximize vertical ascent.

### Updated Approach

We will select a more appropriate motor and adjust the rocket's body and aerodynamic components to optimize the flight profile.

#### Motor Selection

- **CesaroniM1670** was selected previously but did not achieve target apogee due to insufficient thrust. Since the **CesaroniO5800** resulted in overshooting cost constraints, we'll opt for a powerful yet cost-effective motor like **CesaroniO3700** to provide the necessary thrust and impulse.

#### Rocket Body

- **Material**: Carbon fiber is selected for its strength and lightweight characteristics.
- **Dimensions**:
  - **Radius**: 0.161 meters (sufficient to accommodate the motor)
  - **Length**: 3.5 meters to support structural needs and distribute weight effectively.
  - **Wall Thickness**: 0.004 meters, balancing structural integrity and weight.

#### Aerodynamics

- **Nose Cone**:
  - **Shape**: Von Kármán shape for better aerodynamic efficiency.
  - **Length**: 0.5 meters.
  - **Material**: Carbon fiber to maintain low weight.

- **Fins**:
  - **Number**: 4 for stability.
  - **Root Chord**: 0.28 meters.
  - **Tip Chord**: 0.12 meters.
  - **Span**: 0.25 meters for sufficient lift.
  - **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees to minimize drag.
  - **Material**: Carbon fiber.
  - **Thickness**: 0.003 meters.

#### Tail

- **Length**: 0.25 meters.
- **Top Radius**: 0.161 meters.
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.175 meters.
- **Material**: Carbon fiber.

#### Parachutes

- **Main Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: 1.0 for a gentle descent.
  - **Trigger**: "apogee+5" for delayed opening after peak altitude.

- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: 0.4 for initial deceleration.

#### Launch Configuration

- **Rail Length**: 6.0 meters for initial stability.
- **Inclination**: 87 degrees, with a heading adjusted to 180 degrees to counter eastward wind.

#### Payload

- **Mass**: 0.5 kg.
- **Position**: 1.75 meters, centered for balanced CG.
