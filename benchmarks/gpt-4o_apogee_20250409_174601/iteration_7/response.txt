To improve our chances of reaching the desired apogee and addressing the limitations identified in previous attempts, let's perform an analysis and implement a more structured design process.

### Key Learnings from Previous Attempts:

1. **Motor Selection**: The motors used in previous attempts either didn't provide enough thrust for the target apogee or were too costly. Choosing the correct balance is crucial.
   
2. **Aerodynamics**: The shape of the rocket, particularly the nose cone and fins, greatly affects max altitude and stability, especially with strong winds.

3. **Structural Weight**: Lighter materials, like carbon fiber, have been consistently advantageous but are costly.

4. **Parachute Design**: Insufficient parachute designs can lead to unsafe landing velocities.

5. **Launch Configuration**: The launch angle and heading can help mitigate atmospheric conditions.

### Improved Design Strategy:

#### Step 1: Motor Selection
Our previous motor choices resulted in either inadequate launch altitude or exceeded budget constraints. Considering the available options:

- **Motor**: Select **CesaroniK160**. While less powerful, its Isp and extended burn time could allow for a leverage point about achieving adequate altitude affordably.

#### Step 2: Rocket Body
Select materials and dimensions to meet all constraints, balancing structural integrity with weight:

- **Material**: For cost-effectiveness and adequate performance, use **fiberglass**.
- **Radius**: 0.09 meters to accommodate the motor easily.
- **Length**: 3.0 meters, ensuring room for components and enhanced stability.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 meters.

#### Step 3: Nose Cone
Select a design that minimizes drag while accommodating the rocket’s dimensions.

- **Shape**: Opt for **von kármán** for reduced drag efficiency.
- **Length**: 0.45 meters.
- **Material**: Use **composite** material for effective weight management and cost.

#### Step 4: Fins
Ensure stability with increased number and optimized dimensions:

- **Number**: 4 fins for increased stability and control.
- **Material**: Opt for **carbon_fiber** despite cost due to its lightweight, strength.
- **Dimensions**:
  - **Root Chord**: 0.25 meters.
  - **Tip Chord**: 0.125 meters.
  - **Span**: 0.225 meters.
  - **Cant Angle**: 0.5 degrees for roll stability.
  - **Thickness**: 0.003 meters. 

#### Step 5: Tail
Adjust tail dimensions to ensure stabilization and structural soundness:

- **Material**: Select **fiberglass**.
- **Length**: 0.25 meters.
- **Top Radius**: 0.09 meters.
- **Bottom Radius**: 0.10 meters.

#### Step 6: Parachute System
Ensure the parachutes are designed effectively:

- **Main Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: 1.0 for soft landing.
- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: 0.3 for stability during descent.

#### Step 7: Launch Configuration
Adapt launch configuration to counter wind:

- **Launch Rail Length**: 6.0 meters for additional stabilization before motor burnout.
- **Inclination**: 88 degrees for slightly direct upward trajectory.
- **Heading**: 180 degrees against east wind to balance.
  
#### Step 8: Payload
A lightweight payload for practicality:

- **Mass**: 0.5 kg.
- **Position**: 1.5 meters from base for balanced center of gravity.
