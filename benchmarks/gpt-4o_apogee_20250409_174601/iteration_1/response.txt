To design a rocket that meets the requirements and maximizes the score, we need a detailed understanding of each component and the constraints provided. Let's tackle this systematically: 

### Design Considerations and Strategy

1. **Target Apogee**: 3048 meters with minimal deviation.
2. **Wind Conditions**: 20 m/s from the east, so we should consider the aerodynamic stability and adjust launch heading to potentially counteract drift.
3. **Cost Sensitivity**: Keep costs low to improve the cost reward factor.
4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure impact velocity is less than 5 m/s and minimize structural failure risk.
5. **Components**:
   - **Motor**: Choose based on thrust that can achieve desired apogee.
   - **Material**: Balance between weight, cost, and strength.
   - **Parachute**: Ensure a safe landing velocity.
   - **Aerodynamics**: Minimize drag and optimize for the wind.

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### Step 1: Motor Selection
- **CesaroniK160**: It's a reasonable balance for achieving near-target apogee without excessive costs since it has a relatively high Isp and thrust, but it's designed for longer burns.

#### Step 2: Rocket Body
- **Material**: Use **fiberglass**. It's cost-effective and provides a good balance of strength-to-weight.
- **Dimensions**: 
  - **Radius**: Slightly larger than the motor radius to ensure fitment. Motor radius is 54 mm, so choose 0.08 meters.
  - **Length**: Start with 1.8 meters for the body to accommodate the motor and payload effectively.
  - **Wall Thickness**: 0.005 meters for structural integrity.

#### Step 3: Nose Cone
- **Shape**: Opt for an **ogive shape** for reduced drag, common in atmospheric aerodynamics.
- **Length and Material**: 0.2 meters using **fiberglass**.

#### Step 4: Fins
- **Number & Material**: Use 3 fins made of **carbon_fiber** for aerodynamic stability and minimal weight.
- **Dimensions**:
  - Root Chord: 0.15 meters
  - Tip Chord: 0.075 meters
  - Span: 0.15 meters
  - Cant Angle: 0 degrees for simplicity and minimizing drag
  - Thickness: 0.003 meters

#### Step 5: Tail
- **Material**: Use **carbon_fiber** to ensure strength with lightweight characteristics.
- **Design**: A simple flare for stability, top radius of 0.08 meters and bottom radius of 0.1 meters.
  
#### Step 6: Parachute System
- **Main Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: Design for a descent rate of approximately 4.5 m/s.
  - Area estimation: 0.5 (requires some iteration and testing)
- **Drogue Parachute**:
  - **Cd_S**: Smaller surface area designed for controlled descent post-apogee, set at 0.15.

#### Step 7: Launch Rail
- **Length**: 5 meters to ensure full velocity stabilization before leaving the rail.
- **Inclination**: Set to 88 degrees, slightly off vertical, accounting for wind drift with a heading towards the wind (180 degrees to counter east wind).

#### Step 8: Payload
- Include a lightweight payload to simulate realistic flight conditions without greatly affecting performance.
- Set mass to 1 kg placed at the center (position: 0.9 meters) adjacent to the rocket's center of gravity.
