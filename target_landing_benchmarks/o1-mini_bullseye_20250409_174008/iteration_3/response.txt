## Rocket Design Reasoning

Designing a rocket to meet the specified requirements involves balancing multiple factors, including achieving the target apogee, ensuring safe landings, minimizing costs, and accurately landing at the desired coordinates. Below is a comprehensive step-by-step reasoning to optimize the rocket design based on the provided criteria and feedback from previous attempts.

### **1. Motor Selection**

**Available Motors Analysis:**

- **Pro75M1670 (CTI)**
  - **Total Impulse:** 6,023.6 Ns
  - **Dry Mass:** 1.815 kg

- **AeroTechK700W (AT)**
  - **Total Impulse:** 2,249 Ns
  - **Dry Mass:** 0.732 kg

- **CesaroniM1670 (CTI)**
  - **Total Impulse:** 6,023.6 Ns
  - **Dry Mass:** 3.101 kg

- **AeroTechH128W (AT)**
  - **Total Impulse:** 176.5 Ns
  - **Dry Mass:** 0.108 kg

- **CesaroniO3700 (CTI)**
  - **Total Impulse:** 29,930.2 Ns
  - **Dry Mass:** 14.194 kg

- **CesaroniO5800 (CTI)**
  - **Total Impulse:** 30,382.7 Ns
  - **Dry Mass:** 12.418 kg

- **CesaroniK160 (CTI)**
  - **Total Impulse:** 1,521.7 Ns
  - **Dry Mass:** 0.7 kg

**Choice:**

To achieve the target apogee of **1,000 meters**, we need a motor that provides sufficient total impulse. Using the basic physics equation for apogee:

\[
h = \frac{V^2}{2g}
\]

\[
V = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 1000} \approx 140 \text{ m/s}
\]

The required total impulse \( I \) can be estimated as:

\[
I = m_{\text{total}} \times \Delta V
\]

Assuming a total mass \( m_{\text{total}} \) of approximately **20 kg** (including motor, body, payload, etc.), the required impulse \( I \) is:

\[
I = 20 \times 140 = 2,800 \text{ Ns}
\]

**Selected Motor:**

- **Pro75M1670 (CTI)**
  - **Total Impulse:** 6,023.6 Ns
  - **Dry Mass:** 1.815 kg

**Rationale:**

- The **Pro75M1670** provides more than the required impulse, ensuring the rocket can achieve the target apogee.
- It has a lower dry mass compared to motors like **CesaroniO5800**, aiding in overall weight management and cost efficiency.

### **2. Rocket Body Design**

- **Motor Radius:** 75 mm = 0.075 m
- **Selected Body Radius:** **0.09 m** (ensures it's greater than the motor radius)
- **Body Length:** **1.5 m** (accommodates motor, payload, and structural components)
- **Material:** **Fiberglass** (offers a good balance between strength, weight, and cost)
- **Thickness:** **0.005 m** (adequate for structural integrity without excessive weight)

### **3. Nose Cone Design**

- **Shape:** **Ogive** (superior aerodynamic efficiency reduces drag)
- **Length:** **0.3 m** (streamlined to complement body length)
- **Material:** **Composite** (lightweight and durable)

### **4. Fins Design**

- **Number of Fins:** **4** (provides good stability)
- **Root Chord:** **0.2 m**
- **Tip Chord:** **0.1 m**
- **Span:** **0.3 m**
- **Cant Angle:** **3 degrees** (minimal to counteract wind without compromising stability)
- **Material:** **Carbon_fiber** (strength and lightweight)
- **Thickness:** **0.005 m**

### **5. Tail Design**

- **Length:** **0.3 m**
- **Top Radius:** **0.04 m**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.05 m** (different from top radius to avoid design errors)
- **Material:** **Carbon_fiber** (consistent strength with fins)

### **6. Parachute Specifications**

To ensure a safe landing with an impact velocity below **5 m/s**:

- **Main Parachute:**
  - **Drag Coefficient Area (cd_s):** **1.0 m²**
  - **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate:** **105**
  - **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
  - **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

- **Drogue Parachute:**
  - **Drag Coefficient Area (cd_s):** **0.4 m²**
  - **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate:** **105**
  - **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
  - **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

### **7. Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length:** **1.5 m** (adequate for stabilization)
- **Inclination:** **90 degrees** (vertical launch)
- **Heading:** **25 degrees** (adjusted to compensate for wind drift and aim towards the target coordinates)

**Wind Drift Compensation:**

- **Wind Speed:** **20 m/s** from East
- **Estimated Total Flight Time:** **30 seconds**
- **Total Drift East:** \( 20 \times 30 = 600 \) meters

To land accurately at **(3000.0m, 5000.0m)**, the launch heading is adjusted to **25 degrees** to account for the **600m** eastward drift caused by wind.

### **8. Payload Specifications**

- **Mass:** **0.5 kg** (lightweight to aid in achieving the target apogee)
- **Position:** **0.5 m** from the rocket center (ensures balanced center of mass)

### **Final Design Configuration**

Based on the above reasoning, the optimized rocket design is as follows:

### **Rationale for Design Choices:**

- **Motor Selection:** The **Pro75M1670** offers a sufficient total impulse to achieve the target apogee while maintaining a lower dry mass, enhancing overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

- **Materials:** 
  - **Fiberglass** for the body ensures a lightweight yet strong structure.
  - **Composite** for the nose cone minimizes aerodynamic drag.
  - **Carbon_fiber** for fins and tail provides the necessary strength and stability without adding excessive weight.

- **Aerodynamics:** 
  - An **ogive** nose cone reduces drag, aiding in achieving the desired apogee.
  - Proper fin sizing and a subtle **cant angle** of **3 degrees** ensure stability against the eastward wind, preventing unwanted drift.

- **Parachutes:** 
  - The combination of a **1.0 m²** main parachute and a **0.4 m²** drogue parachute ensures a controlled and safe descent, keeping the impact velocity below the **5 m/s** threshold.

- **Launch Configuration:** 
  - A **25-degree** launch heading compensates for the expected **600m** eastward drift caused by the **20 m/s** wind, aiming the rocket to land precisely at **(3000.0m, 5000.0m)**.

- **Payload:** 
  - A **0.5 kg** payload strikes a balance between functionality and weight, contributing minimally to overall mass while allowing space for necessary instrumentation.

- **Cost Efficiency:** 
  - By selecting materials like **fiberglass** and optimizing component sizes, the design maintains structural integrity and performance while keeping costs lower compared to previous attempts.

- **Safety:** 
  - Adequate parachute sizing and a robust structural design ensure the rocket lands safely without breaking, adhering to the impact velocity requirement.

This configuration aims to optimize the scoring criteria by accurately achieving the target apogee, ensuring safe landings, minimizing costs, and precisely landing at the desired coordinates despite challenging wind conditions.
