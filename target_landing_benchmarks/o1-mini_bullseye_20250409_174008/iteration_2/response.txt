Sure, let's work through an improved rocket design to better meet the specified requirements and optimize the scoring criteria. We'll address each design component step-by-step, making informed choices based on the available materials and motors.

### **1. Motor Selection**

**Available Motors Analysis:**

- **Pro75M1670 (CTI):** Total Impulse = 6,023.6 Ns
- **CesaroniO5800 (CTI):** Total Impulse = 30,382.7 Ns
- **Others:** Offer varying impulses but none exceed the CesaroniO5800.

**Choice:**
- **CesaroniO5800** is selected due to its high total impulse (~30,382.7 Ns), which is essential to achieve the target apogee of 1,000 meters. Although it has a higher dry mass (12.418 kg) and cost, its performance benefits outweigh these drawbacks for this design goal.

### **2. Rocket Body Design**

- **Radius:** Must be greater than the motor radius (0.15 m). Selected **0.16 m** to ensure adequate clearance.
- **Length:** **2.0 m** to accommodate the motor, payload, and structural components.
- **Material:** **Carbon_fiber** is chosen for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio, providing structural integrity while keeping the rocket lightweight.
- **Thickness:** **0.01 m** ensures the body is robust enough to handle the stresses during launch and flight without adding excessive weight.

### **3. Nose Cone Design**

- **Shape:** **Ogive** for superior aerodynamic efficiency, reducing drag and contributing to better flight stability.
- **Length:** **0.3 m** to provide a streamlined profile that complements the body length.
- **Material:** **Composite** for its lightweight and durable properties, ensuring the nose cone can withstand aerodynamic forces.

### **4. Fins Design**

- **Number:** **4** fins offer a good balance between stability and aerodynamic efficiency.
- **Root Chord:** **0.3 m** provides a substantial base for the fins, enhancing stability.
- **Tip Chord:** **0.15 m** ensures a tapered design that reduces drag.
- **Span:** **0.3 m** for adequate surface area to maintain stable flight.

  - **Sampling Rate:** **105**
  - **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
  - **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**
  
- **Drogue Parachute:**
  - **cd_s:** **0.6 m²** for initial stabilization and controlled descent.
  - **Trigger:** **apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate:** **105**
  - **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
  - **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

### **7. Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length:** **2.0 m** to provide sufficient stabilization during launch.
- **Inclination:** **90 degrees** for a vertical launch.
- **Heading:** **45 degrees** to direct the rocket towards the target coordinates (3000.0m, 5000.0m), accounting for wind drift from the East.

### **8. Payload Specifications**

- **Mass:** **1.0 kg** to keep the rocket lightweight yet capable of carrying necessary instrumentation.
- **Position:** **1.0 m** from the rocket center to maintain balance and center of mass.

### **Rationale for Design Choices:**

- **Motor Selection:** The **CesaroniO5800** provides a high total impulse (~30,382.7 Ns), which is crucial for reaching the target apogee of 1,000 meters. Despite its higher dry mass, its performance ensures better apogee accuracy.
  
- **Materials:** **Carbon_fiber** and **composite** materials are chosen for their excellent strength-to-weight ratios, ensuring the rocket remains both lightweight and structurally sound, which contributes to cost efficiency and safety.
  
- **Aerodynamics:** An **ogive** nose cone minimizes drag, while appropriately sized fins with a cant angle counteract wind drift, ensuring the rocket lands closer to the target coordinates. The distinct top and bottom radii in the tail design prevent structural errors.
  
- **Parachutes:** The combined area of the main and drogue parachutes ensures effective deceleration, maintaining impact velocities below the 5 m/s threshold for safe landings.
  
- **Launch Configuration:** Launching at a **45-degree heading** directs the rocket towards the target coordinates while compensating for the easterly wind. The vertical inclination aids in achieving the necessary apogee.
  
- **Payload:** A **1.0 kg** payload provides necessary instrumentation without significantly impacting the rocket's performance, balancing between functionality and cost efficiency.

This enhanced configuration is designed to significantly improve the apogee accuracy, ensure safe landing velocities, and position the rocket close to the target coordinates while maintaining cost-effectiveness and structural integrity.
