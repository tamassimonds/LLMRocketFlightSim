  - **cd_s:** **0.6 m²**
  - **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate:** **105**
  - **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
  - **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

### **7. Launch Rail Configuration**

- **Rail Length:** **2.0 m** to provide adequate stabilization during launch.
- **Inclination:** **90 degrees** for a vertical launch.
- **Heading:** **270 degrees** to counteract the 20 m/s wind from the East.

### **8. Payload Specifications**

- **Mass:** **0.2 kg** to keep the rocket lightweight.
- **Position:** **0.5 m** from the rocket center to maintain balance.

### **Rationale for Design Choices:**

- **Motor Selection:** The Pro75M1670 provides sufficient total impulse to reach the target apogee while keeping the dry mass and cost low.
- **Materials:** Fiberglass and carbon_fiber are chosen for their strength-to-weight ratios, ensuring the rocket remains lightweight yet robust.
- **Aerodynamics:** A conical nose cone and properly sized fins ensure stable and efficient flight. The tail design prevents structural errors by having distinct top and bottom radii.
- **Parachutes:** The combined area of the main and drogue parachutes ensures a safe landing by keeping the impact velocity below the threshold.
- **Launch Configuration:** Aligning the launch heading opposite to the wind minimizes drift, ensuring the rocket lands closer to the target coordinates.
- **Payload:** A lightweight payload reduces the overall mass, contributing to cost efficiency and better apogee performance.

This configuration is designed to balance all scoring aspects effectively, ensuring performance, safety, and cost-efficiency.
