To design a rocket that can successfully reach a target apogee, meet all design requirements, and land safely, I’ll evaluate the available motors and components while ensuring the rocket is lightweight and affordable. The design process involves selecting the appropriate motor, body dimensions, nose cone shape, fins, parachute specifications, and launching configuration.

### 1. Motor Selection
The target apogee is set at (3000.0m, 5000.0m). A solid motor capable of producing sufficient thrust is essential. From the motor list, the **CesaroniM1670** and **CesaroniO5800** are high-thrust motors, but I will go with **AeroTechK700W**, which offers good thrust and a lower total weight.

- **Motor Choice**: `AeroTechK700W`
- **Max Thrust**: 1029.3 N
- **Avg Thrust**: 658.7 N

### 2. Rocket Body Selection
Considering the selected motor radius of 0.054 m (54 mm), our rocket body radius should be larger than 0.054 m. Choosing a radius of 0.08 m (80 mm) will provide adequate structural integrity and reduce mass.

- **Body Radius**: 0.08 m
- **Body Length**: 1.5 m
- **Material**: Using *fiberglass* due to its lightweight yet strong properties.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m for sufficient robustness.

### 3. Nose Cone Design
For the nose cone, an ogive shape is often aerodynamically efficient, reducing drag. I’ll set the length to 0.3 m and use the same fiberglass material for consistency.

- **Nose Cone Shape**: `ogive`
- **Nose Cone Length**: 0.3 m  
- **Material**: `fiberglass`

### 4. Fin Design
Fins are crucial for stability during flight. I will design four fins: 

- **Number of Fins**: 4
- **Root Chord**: 0.1 m
- **Tip Chord**: 0.05 m
- **Span**: 0.25 m
- **Cant Angle**: 5 degrees to ensure stability.
- **Material**: *carbon_fiber* for its lightweight and high strength.
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m.

### 5. Parachute Specifications
For recovery, I’ll utilize both a main and a drogue parachute.

- **Main Parachute CD_s**: 0.25 (4.0m diameter parachute)
- **Drogue Parachute CD_s**: 0.15 (3.0m diameter parachute)

### 6. Launch Rail Configuration
For launching, I'll set the rail length to 3.0 m, inclined at 90 degrees, for a vertical launch.

- **Rail Length**: 3.0 m
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees (straight up)
- **Heading**: 0 degrees

### 7. Payload Specifications
Assuming a small payload mass for calculations, let’s set it to 0.5 kg, positioned at 0.75 m (halfway up the main body).

### Full Configuration
Putting it all together, here’s the design in Python dictionary format:

### Rationale and Calculations
- The selection of materials was aimed at optimizing weight while maintaining strength.
- The motor chosen should provide sufficient thrust and impulse for the desired height.
- Fin dimensions consider aerodynamic efficiency and stability requirements.
- Parachute specifications are critical for safe descent speed, which must remain below 5 m/s to avoid damage.
- The overall design provides an option for adjustments based on simulation results to achieve the target landing coordinates. 

This initial design should be tested under simulated conditions to validate performance before any actual launch. Adjustments may be needed based on feedback from those simulations.
