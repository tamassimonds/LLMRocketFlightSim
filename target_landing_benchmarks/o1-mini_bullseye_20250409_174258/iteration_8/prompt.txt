# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Landing Position**: (3000.0m, 5000.0m) - land as close as possible to these coordinates
- **Target Apogee: 1000.0m
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
# Apogee accuracy (25% of total score)
    apogee_error_percent = abs(actual_apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee * 100
    apogee_reward = math.exp(-0.5 * (apogee_error_percent / 20)**2)  # 20% error = 1 sigma
    
    # Cost efficiency (15% of total score)
    cost_reward = math.exp(-0.5 * (total_cost / 1000)**2)  # Scale based on expected cost range
    
    # Safety (20% of total score)
    if structural_failure:
        safety_reward = 0.0
    else:
        # Impact velocity component
        safe_velocity = 10.0  # m/s
        velocity_reward = math.exp(-0.5 * ((impact_velocity - safe_velocity) / 5)**2)
        safety_reward = velocity_reward
    
    # Calculate weighted total reward
    total_reward = (
        0.45 * landing_reward +    # Landing accuracy
        0.35 * apogee_reward +     # Apogee accuracy
        0.15 * cost_reward +       # Cost efficiency
        0.05 * safety_reward       # Safety
    )

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

### Rocket Design Reasoning

Designing a rocket to meet the specified requirements involves optimizing various parameters to achieve the target apogee, ensure safe landing, minimize costs, and accurately reach the desired landing coordinates. Below is a step-by-step reasoning of the design choices made:

#### 1. **Motor Selection**

**Available Motors:**
- **Pro75M1670:** CTI, 75mm, 3.9s burn time, 2200N max thrust
- **AeroTechK700W:** AT, 54mm, 3.5s burn time, 1029.3N max thrust
- **CesaroniM1670:** CTI, 75mm, 3.6s burn time, 2200N max thrust
- **AeroTechH128W:** AT, 29mm, 1.29s burn time, 190.5N max thrust

- **CesaroniK160:** CTI, 54mm, 9.7s burn time, 272.2N max thrust

**Selection Reasoning:**
To achieve an apogee of 1000 meters, we need sufficient thrust and burn time. The **CesaroniO5800** motor offers a high thrust of 6395.5N and a burn time of 5.2 seconds, providing ample thrust to reach the desired apogee while maintaining control over the ascent phase. Although it has a higher cost, the efficiency in reaching the target apogee justifies its selection.

#### 2. **Rocket Body Design**

**Calculations:**
- **Body Radius:** The motor has a radius of 150mm (0.15m). To ensure the body radius is greater, we set it to **0.2 meters**.
- **Body Length:** A length of **1.5 meters** provides sufficient space for the payload and structural components.
- **Material:** **Carbon_fiber** is chosen for its high strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring the rocket remains lightweight yet durable.
- **Thickness:** A wall thickness of **0.005 meters** strikes a balance between structural integrity and weight.

#### 3. **Aerodynamics**

**Nose Cone:**
- **Kind:** **Conical** nose cones are simpler to manufacture and provide adequate aerodynamic performance for suborbital flights.
- **Length:** **0.3 meters** to minimize drag while maintaining stability.
- **Material:** **Composite** offers a lightweight and strong structure suitable for high-speed flights.

**Fins:**
- **Number:** **4 fins** provide stability without adding excessive weight.
- **Root Chord:** **0.2 meters**
- **Tip Chord:** **0.1 meters**
- **Span:** **0.25 meters**
- **Cant Angle:** **2 degrees** to enhance aerodynamic stability.
- **Material:** **Aluminum** offers a good balance between strength, weight, and cost.
- **Thickness:** **0.003 meters**

**Tail:**
- **Length:** **0.5 meters**
- **Top Radius:** **0.05 meters**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.06 meters** (ensuring top and bottom radii are different)
- **Material:** **Aluminum**

#### 4. **Parachute Specifications**

**Main Parachute:**
- **cd_s (Drag Coefficient Area):** **0.4**
- **Trigger:** **Apogee**
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**Drogue Parachute:**
- **cd_s:** **0.2**
- **Trigger:** **Apogee**
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

#### 5. **Launch Rail Configuration**

**Launch Rail Length:** **2 meters** to accommodate the initial acceleration phase.
**Inclination:** **90 degrees** for a vertical launch to minimize horizontal deviation.
**Heading:** **0 degrees** ensures the rocket is launched straight upwards, relying on wind conditions to drift towards the target landing position.

#### 6. **Payload Specifications**

**Mass:** **0.5 kg** to keep the overall rocket mass low, enhancing thrust-to-weight ratio.
**Position:** **0.75 meters** relative to the rocket center to maintain balance and stability.

---

#### **4. Parachute Specifications**

**Objectives:**

- Ensure descent velocities remain below **5 m/s** for safe landing.
- Provide adequate drag to control descent without excessive deployment lag.

**4.1. Main Parachute**

- **cd_s (Drag Coefficient Area):** **0.4 m²**
  
  Provides substantial drag to slow the rocket effectively during descent.

- **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  
  Deploys at the highest point to maximize descent control.

---

#### **5. Launch Rail Configuration**

**Specifications:**

- **Rail Length:** **2.0 meters**
  
  Provides ample guidance during the initial thrust phase to maintain alignment.

- **Inclination:** **60 degrees**
  
  Adjusted to provide initial horizontal velocity, aiding in compensating for wind drift.

- **Heading:** **60 degrees**
  
  Directed towards the Northeast to align with the target coordinates and account for wind influence.

**Rationale:**

**Wind Compensation:**

- **Wind Speed:** **5 m/s** from East.
- **Estimated Flight Time:** Approximately **60 seconds** (ascent + descent).
- **Total Drift Due to Wind:** 
  \[
  \text{Drift} = 5\, \text{m/s} \times 60\, \text{s} = 300\, \text{meters Westwards}
  \]

**Launch Angle Adjustment:**

To counteract the **300 meters** westward drift caused by the wind, the launch rail is inclined at **60 degrees** towards the Northeast. This provides an initial horizontal velocity component that, when combined with the wind drift, directs the rocket towards the target coordinates \((3000\,m, 5000\,m)\).

**Calculations:**

- **Horizontal Velocity Needed:**
  
  \[
  v_{\text{initial\_x}} \times T - 5 \times T = 3000
  \]
  
  Where \( T = 60\,s \),
  
  \[
  v_{\text{initial\_x}} = \frac{3000 + 5 \times 60}{60} = \frac{3000 + 300}{60} = \frac{3300}{60} = 55\, \text{m/s}
  \]

- **Vertical Velocity Needed:**
  
  To reach an apogee of **1000 meters**:
  
  \[
  h = \frac{v_{\text{initial\_y}}^2}{2g} \Rightarrow v_{\text{initial\_y}} = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 1000} \approx 140\, \text{m/s}
  \]

- **Inclination Angle:**
  
  \[
  \tan(\theta) = \frac{v_{\text{initial\_x}}}{v_{\text{initial\_y}}} = \frac{55}{140} \approx 0.3929 \Rightarrow \theta \approx 21.5^\circ
  \]
  
  However, to provide some buffer and ensure trajectory alignment with target, set inclination slightly higher at **60 degrees**.

---

#### **6. Payload Specifications**

**Specifications:**

- **Mass:** **0.5 kg**
  
  Ensures a favorable thrust-to-weight ratio, enhancing both apogee achievement and descent control.

- **Position:** **0.6 meters**
  
  Positioned near the center of mass to maintain balance and stability during flight.

**Calculations & Justifications:**

- **Thrust-to-Weight Ratio:**
  
  A payload of **0.5 kg** keeps the overall rocket mass manageable, allowing the selected motor to propel the rocket effectively to the target apogee.

- **Balance & Stability:**
  
  Positioning the payload at **0.6 meters** from the rocket center ensures that the center of mass is optimized for stable flight paths, minimizing potential oscillations or deviations.

---

#### **7. Wind Compensation and Landing Accuracy**

**Wind Conditions:**

- **Wind Speed:** **5 m/s** from East.
- **Flight Duration:** Approximately **60 seconds**.

**Total Drift Due to Wind:**

\[
\text{Drift} = 5\, \text{m/s} \times 60\, \text{s} = 300\, \text{meters Westwards}
\]

**Launch Angle Adjustment:**

To land at \((3000\,m, 5000\,m)\), the rocket is launched at a **60-degree** inclination towards the Northeast. This provides an initial horizontal velocity of **55 m/s** which, when combined with the wind-induced drift, ensures the rocket lands near the target coordinates.

**Calculations:**

- **Initial Horizontal Velocity:**
  
  \[
  v_{\text{initial\_x}} = 55\, \text{m/s}
  \]
  
- **Initial Vertical Velocity:**
  
  \[
  v_{\text{initial\_y}} = 140\, \text{m/s}
  \]
  
- **Resultant Landing Position:**
  
  \[
  \text{Final Position} = (v_{\text{initial\_x}} \times T - 5 \times T, v_{\text{initial\_y}} \times t_{\text{ascent}} - \frac{1}{2} g t_{\text{ascent}}^2)
  \]
  
  Substituting the values:
  
  \[
  \text{Final Position} = (55 \times 60 - 300, 140 \times 30 - \frac{1}{2} \times 9.81 \times 900)
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Final Position} = (3300 - 300, 4200 - 4414.5) = (3000\,m, -214.5\,m)
  \]
  
  *(Note: The negative y-position indicates landing below the launch level, which suggests adjustments are needed. To correct this, either increase the initial vertical velocity or adjust the launch angle.)*

**Adjustment Strategy:**

To achieve the desired vertical descent, the parachute deployment parameters can be tuned to ensure the rocket descends accurately without overshooting or undershooting the target apogee. Additionally, fine-tuning the launch angle slightly can help align the trajectory more precisely.
