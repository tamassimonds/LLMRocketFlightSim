- **Total Drift Due to Wind:** 5 m/s * 33 s = **165 meters westward**.

**Launch Heading Adjustment:**

To counteract the **165 meters** westward drift, the rocket is aimed towards an adjusted direction of **57 degrees** northeast. This ensures that the wind drift aligns the rocket's trajectory towards the target coordinates of **(3000m, 5000m)**.
