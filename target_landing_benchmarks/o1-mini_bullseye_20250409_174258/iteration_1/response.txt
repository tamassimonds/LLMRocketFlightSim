### Rocket Design Reasoning

Designing a rocket to meet the specified requirements involves optimizing various parameters to achieve the target apogee, ensure safe landing, minimize costs, and accurately reach the desired landing coordinates. Below is a step-by-step reasoning of the design choices made:

#### 1. **Motor Selection**

**Available Motors:**
- **Pro75M1670:** CTI, 75mm, 3.9s burn time, 2200N max thrust
- **AeroTechK700W:** AT, 54mm, 3.5s burn time, 1029.3N max thrust
- **CesaroniM1670:** CTI, 75mm, 3.6s burn time, 2200N max thrust
- **AeroTechH128W:** AT, 29mm, 1.29s burn time, 190.5N max thrust
- **CesaroniO3700:** CTI, 161mm, 8.2s burn time, 4030.3N max thrust
- **CesaroniO5800:** CTI, 150mm, 5.2s burn time, 6395.5N max thrust
- **CesaroniK160:** CTI, 54mm, 9.7s burn time, 272.2N max thrust

**Selection Reasoning:**
To achieve an apogee of 1000 meters, we need sufficient thrust and burn time. The **CesaroniO5800** motor offers a high thrust of 6395.5N and a burn time of 5.2 seconds, providing ample thrust to reach the desired apogee while maintaining control over the ascent phase. Although it has a higher cost, the efficiency in reaching the target apogee justifies its selection.

#### 2. **Rocket Body Design**

**Calculations:**
- **Body Radius:** The motor has a radius of 150mm (0.15m). To ensure the body radius is greater, we set it to **0.2 meters**.
- **Body Length:** A length of **1.5 meters** provides sufficient space for the payload and structural components.
- **Material:** **Carbon_fiber** is chosen for its high strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring the rocket remains lightweight yet durable.
- **Thickness:** A wall thickness of **0.005 meters** strikes a balance between structural integrity and weight.

#### 3. **Aerodynamics**

**Nose Cone:**
- **Kind:** **Conical** nose cones are simpler to manufacture and provide adequate aerodynamic performance for suborbital flights.
- **Length:** **0.3 meters** to minimize drag while maintaining stability.
- **Material:** **Composite** offers a lightweight and strong structure suitable for high-speed flights.

**Fins:**
- **Number:** **4 fins** provide stability without adding excessive weight.
- **Root Chord:** **0.2 meters**
- **Tip Chord:** **0.1 meters**
- **Span:** **0.25 meters**
- **Cant Angle:** **2 degrees** to enhance aerodynamic stability.
- **Material:** **Aluminum** offers a good balance between strength, weight, and cost.
- **Thickness:** **0.003 meters**

**Tail:**
- **Length:** **0.5 meters**
- **Top Radius:** **0.05 meters**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.06 meters** (ensuring top and bottom radii are different)
- **Material:** **Aluminum**

#### 4. **Parachute Specifications**

**Main Parachute:**
- **cd_s (Drag Coefficient Area):** **0.4**
- **Trigger:** **Apogee**
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**Drogue Parachute:**
- **cd_s:** **0.2**
- **Trigger:** **Apogee**
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

#### 5. **Launch Rail Configuration**

**Launch Rail Length:** **2 meters** to accommodate the initial acceleration phase.
**Inclination:** **90 degrees** for a vertical launch to minimize horizontal deviation.
**Heading:** **0 degrees** ensures the rocket is launched straight upwards, relying on wind conditions to drift towards the target landing position.

#### 6. **Payload Specifications**

**Mass:** **0.5 kg** to keep the overall rocket mass low, enhancing thrust-to-weight ratio.
**Position:** **0.75 meters** relative to the rocket center to maintain balance and stability.
