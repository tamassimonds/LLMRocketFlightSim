**Selection Criteria:**

- **Apogee Achievement:** The motor must provide sufficient thrust and burn time to reach the target apogee of 1000 meters.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Cheaper motors are preferred to maximize the cost-efficiency score.
- **Landing Safety:** Moderate thrust ensures better control over descent velocities.

**Analysis:**

- **High-Thrust Motors (CesaroniO3700 & CesaroniO5800):** Provide excessive thrust, leading to potential overshooting of the apogee and high landing velocities, which could compromise safety.
  
- **Low-Thrust Motors (AeroTechH128W & CesaroniK160):** Insufficient thrust to reach the target apogee reliably.

- **Balanced Options:**
  - **Pro75M1670 & CesaroniM1670:** Both offer 2200 N thrust with similar performance, providing a good balance between sufficient thrust and cost.
  - **AeroTechK700W:** Offers moderate thrust with better cost efficiency compared to higher thrust options.

**Chosen Motor:** **Pro75M1670**

**Rationale:**

- **Thrust:** 2200 N is sufficient to achieve the target apogee without causing excessive velocities that may lead to high impact speeds.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Lower cost compared to high-thrust motors.
- **Burn Time:** 3.9 seconds provides a controlled ascent phase.

  Adjusted to account for wind conditions (5 m/s from East) aiming towards the target coordinates (3000m, 5000m).

**Rationale:**

Launching at a **45-degree heading** towards the Northwest compensates for the Eastward wind, directing the rocket's trajectory towards the target landing position.

**Flight Duration Estimate:**

Assuming total flight time (ascent + descent) of approximately **120 seconds**.

**Wind Drift Calculation:**

- **Horizontal Drift:** Wind can cause the rocket to drift horizontally during ascent and descent.

- **Total Drift:** 5 m/s * 120 s = **600 meters** towards West.

**Adjusted Launch Heading:**

To land at **(3000m, 5000m)**, adjust the launch heading to **approximately 53 degrees** towards Northeast. This accounts for the westward drift, ensuring that the resultant landing position aligns with the target coordinates.
