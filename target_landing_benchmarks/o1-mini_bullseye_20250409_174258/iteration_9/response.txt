**Chosen Motor:** **CesaroniK160**

**Rationale:**

- **Thrust & Burn Time:** Provides an average thrust of **190.2 N** over a burn time of **9.7 seconds**, allowing for controlled ascent.
  
- **Total Impulse:** **1521.7 Ns** is adequate for a lightweight design to reach the desired apogee without overshooting.
  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Lower total impulse compared to high-thrust motors, aligning with cost-efficiency criteria.

---

#### **2. Rocket Body Design**

**Requirements:**

- **Radius:** Must be greater than the motor radius (**54 mm** or **0.054 m**).
- **Material:** Selected from the available list to balance weight, strength, and cost.
- **Thickness:** Sufficient to withstand structural stresses without adding unnecessary weight.

**Design Choices:**

- **Radius:** **0.07 meters**
  
  Ensures a clear fit around the motor (0.054 m) while minimizing aerodynamic drag.
  
- **Length:** **1.0 meter**
  
  Balances structural integrity with aerodynamic efficiency, providing sufficient space for payload and internal components.
  
- **Material:** **Composite**
  
  Offers a high strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring the rocket remains lightweight yet durable.
  
- **Thickness:** **0.003 meters**
  
  Provides structural integrity while keeping the overall weight low.

**Calculations & Justifications:**

- **Volume Calculation:**
  
  \[
  \text{Volume} = 2\pi r \times l \times \text{thickness} = 2\pi (0.07\,m) \times 1.0\,m \times 0.003\,m \approx 0.00132\,m^3
  \]
  
- **Mass Estimation:**
  
  Assuming the density of composite material is approximately **1600 kg/m³**:
  
  \[
  \text{Mass} = 0.00132\,m^3 \times 1600\,kg/m^3 \approx 2.11\,kg
  \]
  
- **Total Mass Considerations:**
  
  - **Motor:** 0.7 kg
  - **Payload:** 0.5 kg
  - **Body:** 2.11 kg
  - **Fins & Tail:** 1 kg
  - **Parachutes & Other Components:** 1.5 kg
  
  **Total Estimated Mass:** ~5.81 kg

**Implications:**

With **CesaroniK160** providing a total impulse of **1521.7 Ns**, the delta-v can be calculated as:

\[
\delta v = \frac{I_{\text{total}}}{m} = \frac{1521.7\,Ns}{5.81\,kg} \approx 261.8\,m/s
\]

This delta-v is sufficient to achieve the target apogee of **1000 meters** while also providing the necessary horizontal velocity to reach the landing coordinates.

---

#### **3. Apogee and Trajectory Calculations**

To ensure the rocket reaches the target apogee of **1000 meters** and lands at **(3000.0m, 5000.0m)**, the following calculations are essential.

**Apogee Calculation:**

\[
h = \frac{v_{y0}^2}{2g} \Rightarrow v_{y0} = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81\,m/s^2 \times 1000\,m} \approx 140\,m/s
\]

**Vertical Flight Time:**

\[
t_{\text{ascent}} = \frac{v_{y0}}{g} = \frac{140}{9.81} \approx 14.25\,s
\]

\[
t_{\text{descent}} \approx 14.25\,s
\]

\[
t_{\text{total}} \approx 28.5\,s
\]

**Horizontal Velocity Requirement:**

To land at **3000m** East:

\[
v_{x0} \times t_{\text{total}} - w \times t_{\text{total}} = 3000\,m
\]

Where:
- \(w\) = wind speed = **5 m/s** Westwards

\[
v_{x0} \times 28.5 - 5 \times 28.5 = 3000
\]

\[
v_{x0} \approx \frac{3000 + 142.5}{28.5} \approx 110\,m/s
\]

**Total Initial Delta-v:**

\[
\delta v = \sqrt{v_{y0}^2 + v_{x0}^2} = \sqrt{140^2 + 110^2} \approx 176\,m/s
\]

**Total Impulse Required:**

\[
I_{\text{required}} = m \times \delta v = 5.81\,kg \times 176\,m/s \approx 1021\,Ns
\]

Given the **CesaroniK160** provides **1521.7 Ns**, this is sufficient to achieve the desired delta-v with a reasonable margin.

#### **4. Aerodynamic Design**

**4.1. Nose Cone**

- **Kind:** **Ogive**
  
  Provides superior aerodynamic performance with reduced drag compared to conical shapes.

- **Length:** **0.2 meters**
  
  Balances aerodynamic efficiency with internal space requirements.

- **Material:** **Composite**
  
  Lightweight and strong, suitable for high-speed flights.

**4.2. Fins**

- **Number:** **4 fins**
  
  Offers enhanced stability without adding excessive weight.

- **Root Chord:** **0.1 meters**
  
- **Tip Chord:** **0.05 meters**
  
- **Span:** **0.25 meters**
  
- **Cant Angle:** **1 degree**
  
  Slight canting enhances aerodynamic stability and control during flight.

- **Material:** **Aluminum**
  
  Provides a good balance between strength, weight, and cost.

- **Thickness:** **0.002 meters**

**Justification:**

Four fins provide better aerodynamic stability compared to three, crucial for maintaining a precise flight path toward the target landing coordinates.

**4.3. Tail**

- **Length:** **0.4 meters**
  
- **Top Radius:** **0.03 meters**
  
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.035 meters**
  
  Differing radii prevent structural errors and ensure manufacturability.

- **Material:** **Aluminum**

---

#### **5. Parachute Specifications**

**Objectives:**

- Ensure descent velocities remain below **5 m/s** for safe landing.
- Provide adequate drag to control descent without excessive deployment lag.

**5.1. Main Parachute**

- **cd_s (Drag Coefficient Area):** **0.35 m²**
  
  Provides sufficient drag to ensure descent velocity remains within safe limits.

- **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  
  Deploys at the highest point to maximize descent control.

- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
  
- **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
  
- **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**5.2. Drogue Parachute**

- **cd_s:** **0.15 m²**
  
  Facilitates initial descent stabilization before the main parachute deployment.

- **Trigger:** **Apogee**
  
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
  
- **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
  
- **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**Justification:**

The combined drag from the main and drogue parachutes ensures that the descent velocity remains well below the safe threshold of **5 m/s**, accounting for the rocket's weight and descent dynamics.

---

#### **6. Launch Rail Configuration**

**Specifications:**

- **Rail Length:** **1.5 meters**
  
  Provides sufficient guidance during the initial thrust phase to maintain alignment.

- **Inclination:** **3 degrees**
  
  Slightly inclined towards East to impart an initial horizontal velocity component.

- **Heading:** **0 degrees**
  
  Aligned with East direction.

**Rationale:**

**Wind Compensation:**

- **Wind Speed:** **5 m/s** Westwards.
  
- **Flight Time:** **28.5 seconds** (ascent + descent).

**Calculated Drift Due to Wind:**

\[
\text{Drift} = w \times t_{\text{total}} = 5\,m/s \times 28.5\,s = 142.5\,m \text{ Westwards}
\]

**Launch Heading Adjustment:**

To compensate for the westward drift, the rocket is launched with an initial horizontal velocity of **110 m/s** East. This ensures that:

\[
v_{x0} \times t_{\text{total}} - w \times t_{\text{total}} = 3000\,m
\]

\[
110\,m/s \times 28.5\,s - 142.5\,m = 3135 - 142.5 = 2992.5 \approx 3000\,m
\]

This alignment ensures the rocket lands near the target coordinates \((3000.0\,m, 5000.0\,m)\).

---

#### **7. Payload Specifications**

**Specifications:**

- **Mass:** **0.5 kg**
  
  Ensures a favorable thrust-to-weight ratio, enhancing both apogee achievement and descent control.

- **Position:** **0.5 meters**
  
  Positioned near the center of mass to maintain balance and stability during flight.

**Calculations & Justifications:**

- **Thrust-to-Weight Ratio:**
  
  \[
  \text{Thrust-to-Weight} = \frac{Thrust}{(Mass \times g)} = \frac{190.2\,N}{(5.81\,kg \times 9.81\,m/s^2)} \approx 3.34
  \]
  
  A ratio greater than **1** ensures the rocket can ascend successfully.

- **Balance & Stability:**
  
  Positioning the payload at **0.5 meters** from the rocket center ensures that the center of mass is optimized for stable flight paths, minimizing potential oscillations or deviations.

---

#### **8. Wind Compensation and Landing Accuracy**

**Wind Conditions:**

- **Wind Speed:** **5 m/s** Westwards.
- **Flight Duration:** Approximately **28.5 seconds**.

**Total Drift Due to Wind:**

\[
\text{Drift} = w \times t_{\text{total}} = 5\,m/s \times 28.5\,s = 142.5\,m \text{ Westwards}
\]

**Launch Heading Adjustment:**

To land at \((3000\,m, 5000\,m)\), the rocket is launched at a **0-degree heading (East)** with an initial horizontal velocity of **110 m/s**. This compensates for the wind-induced westward drift, ensuring the resultant landing position aligns with the target coordinates.

**Calculations:**

\[
x = v_{x0} \times t_{\text{total}} - w \times t_{\text{total}} = 110\,m/s \times 28.5\,s - 142.5\,m \approx 3135 - 142.5 = 2992.5\,m \approx 3000\,m
\]

\[
y = \frac{v_{y0}^2}{2g} = \frac{140^2}{2 \times 9.81} \approx 1000\,m
\]

**Resultant Landing Position:**

\[
(3000\,m, 1000\,m)
\]

*Note:* To achieve a landing at \((3000m, 5000m)\) with an apogee of \(1000m\), the rocket would need to maintain altitude beyond apogee during descent, which is not feasible. Therefore, this design assumes a landing at the apogee point adjusted for horizontal displacement. To achieve the specified landing coordinates, the rocket would require a higher apogee or a different flight profile, which is beyond the current design constraints.
