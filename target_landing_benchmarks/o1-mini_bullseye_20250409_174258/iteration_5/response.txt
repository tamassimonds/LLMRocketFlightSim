#### **2. Rocket Body Design**

**Requirements:**

- **Radius:** Must be greater than the motor radius (**75 mm** or **0.075 m**).
- **Material:** Must be selected from the available list to balance weight, strength, and cost.
- **Thickness:** Adequate to withstand structural stresses without adding unnecessary weight.

  Provides structural integrity while keeping the overall weight low.

**Calculations & Justifications:**

- **Volume Considerations:**
  
  The chosen radius minimizes aerodynamic drag while ensuring the motor fits snugly. A length of **1.2 meters** accommodates the payload and structural components without excessive weight addition.

- **Mass Estimation:**
  
  Utilizing **Carbon_fiber** ensures the body remains lightweight. Estimated mass contribution from the body: 
  \[
  \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 l = \pi (0.1)^2 \times 1.2 \approx 0.0377 \, \text{m}^3
  \]
  Assuming a density of Carbon_fiber ≈ **1600 kg/m³**:
  \[
  \text{Mass} = 0.0377 \times 1600 \approx 60.3 \, \text{kg}
  \]
  *(Note: This is a simplified estimation; actual mass depends on detailed structural design.)*

- **Estimated Flight Time:** Approximately **28.6 seconds** (ascent + descent).
- **Total Drift Due to Wind:** 
  \[
  \text{Drift} = 5\, \text{m/s} \times 28.6\, \text{s} \approx 143\, \text{meters} \, \text{Westwards}
  \]

**Adjusted Launch Heading:**

To counteract the **143 meters** westward drift caused by the wind, the rocket is launched at a **45-degree heading towards the Northeast**. This adjustment ensures that the wind drift aligns the rocket's trajectory towards the target landing coordinates of **(3000m, 5000m)**.

**Calculations & Justifications:**

- **Thrust-to-Weight Ratio:**
  
  A payload of **0.5 kg** keeps the overall rocket mass low, allowing the selected motor to propel the rocket effectively to the target apogee.

- **Balance & Stability:**
  
  Positioning the payload at **0.6 meters** from the rocket center ensures that the center of mass is optimized for stable flight paths, minimizing potential oscillations or deviations.

#### **7. Wind Compensation and Landing Accuracy**

**Wind Conditions:**

- **Wind Speed:** **5 m/s** from East.
- **Estimated Flight Time:** Approximately **28.6 seconds**.

**Total Drift Due to Wind:**

\[
\text{Drift} = 5\, \text{m/s} \times 28.6\, \text{s} \approx 143\, \text{meters Westwards}
\]

**Launch Heading Adjustment:**

To land at **(3000m, 5000m)**, the rocket is launched at a **45-degree heading towards Northeast**. This compensates for the westward drift, ensuring the resultant landing position aligns with the target coordinates.

**Calculations:**

- **Desired Landing Position:** **(3000m, 5000m)**
- **Adjusted Launch Trajectory:** Launching Northeast ensures that the westward drift caused by the wind directs the rocket towards the target.
