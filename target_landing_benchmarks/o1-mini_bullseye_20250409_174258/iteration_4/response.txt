- **Flight Duration:** Approximately **120 seconds**.

- **Total Drift Due to Wind:** 5 m/s * 120 s = **600 meters** towards West.

**Launch Heading Adjustment:**

To land at **(3000m, 5000m)**, the rocket is launched at a **45-degree heading towards Northeast**. This compensates for the westward drift, ensuring the resultant landing position aligns with the target coordinates.

**Calculations:**

- **Adjusted Trajectory:**
  
  By launching Northeast, the wind-induced westward drift shifts the rocket's path towards the target location.

- **Resultant Landing Position:**
  
  The combination of the launch velocity vector and wind-induced drift aligns the rocket's path to land near **(3000m, 5000m)**.
