# Rocket Design Task

## Design Requirements

- **Target Landing Position**: (3000.0m, 5000.0m) - land as close as possible to these coordinates
- **Target Apogee: 1000.0m
- **Wind Conditions**: 5 m/s from E direction

## You are scored off the following
Distance to max apogee
Cost: Cheaper the rocket the better the score
Does it land safely (less than 5 m/s)
Does it not break
Horz distance: How far is it from the intial launch site

#Score func code shown below:
# Apogee accuracy (25% of total score)
    apogee_error_percent = abs(actual_apogee - target_apogee) / target_apogee * 100
    apogee_reward = math.exp(-0.5 * (apogee_error_percent / 20)**2)  # 20% error = 1 sigma
    
    # Cost efficiency (15% of total score)
    cost_reward = math.exp(-0.5 * (total_cost / 1000)**2)  # Scale based on expected cost range
    
    # Safety (20% of total score)
    if structural_failure:
        safety_reward = 0.0
    else:
        # Impact velocity component
        safe_velocity = 10.0  # m/s
        velocity_reward = math.exp(-0.5 * ((impact_velocity - safe_velocity) / 5)**2)
        safety_reward = velocity_reward
    
    # Calculate weighted total reward
    total_reward = (
        0.45 * landing_reward +    # Landing accuracy
        0.35 * apogee_reward +     # Apogee accuracy
        0.15 * cost_reward +       # Cost efficiency
        0.05 * safety_reward       # Safety
    )

## Design Task

Based on the requirements and available components, design a rocket that will reach the target apogee. Your design should include:

1. Motor selection (choose from the available motors list)
2. Body dimensions and material
3. Nose cone dimensions and material
4. Fin design and material
5. Parachute specifications
6. Launch rail configuration


### Notes
DRC are run on the design so you need to make sure the design is feasible.
Here are some of the checks:
Notes for the tail the top and bottom radius cannot be the same (causes error)
The material must be specified exactly as listed above
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius
Nose cone but by exactly one of the listed 
Don't include any additional python code (other than config. Putting calculation in there is ok like 32/4 but not whole functions

### Rocket Design Reasoning

Designing a rocket to meet the specified requirements involves optimizing various parameters to achieve the target apogee, ensure safe landing, minimize costs, and accurately reach the desired landing coordinates. Below is a step-by-step reasoning of the design choices made:

#### 1. **Motor Selection**

**Available Motors:**
- **Pro75M1670:** CTI, 75mm, 3.9s burn time, 2200N max thrust
- **AeroTechK700W:** AT, 54mm, 3.5s burn time, 1029.3N max thrust
- **CesaroniM1670:** CTI, 75mm, 3.6s burn time, 2200N max thrust
- **AeroTechH128W:** AT, 29mm, 1.29s burn time, 190.5N max thrust
- **CesaroniO3700:** CTI, 161mm, 8.2s burn time, 4030.3N max thrust
- **CesaroniO5800:** CTI, 150mm, 5.2s burn time, 6395.5N max thrust
- **CesaroniK160:** CTI, 54mm, 9.7s burn time, 272.2N max thrust

**Selection Reasoning:**
To achieve an apogee of 1000 meters, we need sufficient thrust and burn time. The **CesaroniO5800** motor offers a high thrust of 6395.5N and a burn time of 5.2 seconds, providing ample thrust to reach the desired apogee while maintaining control over the ascent phase. Although it has a higher cost, the efficiency in reaching the target apogee justifies its selection.

#### 2. **Rocket Body Design**

**Calculations:**
- **Body Radius:** The motor has a radius of 150mm (0.15m). To ensure the body radius is greater, we set it to **0.2 meters**.
- **Body Length:** A length of **1.5 meters** provides sufficient space for the payload and structural components.
- **Material:** **Carbon_fiber** is chosen for its high strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring the rocket remains lightweight yet durable.
- **Thickness:** A wall thickness of **0.005 meters** strikes a balance between structural integrity and weight.

#### 3. **Aerodynamics**

**Nose Cone:**
- **Kind:** **Conical** nose cones are simpler to manufacture and provide adequate aerodynamic performance for suborbital flights.
- **Length:** **0.3 meters** to minimize drag while maintaining stability.
- **Material:** **Composite** offers a lightweight and strong structure suitable for high-speed flights.

**Fins:**
- **Number:** **4 fins** provide stability without adding excessive weight.
- **Root Chord:** **0.2 meters**
- **Tip Chord:** **0.1 meters**
- **Span:** **0.25 meters**
- **Cant Angle:** **2 degrees** to enhance aerodynamic stability.
- **Material:** **Aluminum** offers a good balance between strength, weight, and cost.
- **Thickness:** **0.003 meters**

**Tail:**
- **Length:** **0.5 meters**
- **Top Radius:** **0.05 meters**
- **Bottom Radius:** **0.06 meters** (ensuring top and bottom radii are different)
- **Material:** **Aluminum**

#### 4. **Parachute Specifications**

**Main Parachute:**
- **cd_s (Drag Coefficient Area):** **0.4**
- **Trigger:** **Apogee**
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

**Drogue Parachute:**
- **cd_s:** **0.2**
- **Trigger:** **Apogee**
- **Sampling Rate:** **105 Hz**
- **Lag:** **1.5 seconds**
- **Noise:** **(0, 8.3, 0.5)**

#### 5. **Launch Rail Configuration**

**Launch Rail Length:** **2 meters** to accommodate the initial acceleration phase.
**Inclination:** **90 degrees** for a vertical launch to minimize horizontal deviation.
**Heading:** **0 degrees** ensures the rocket is launched straight upwards, relying on wind conditions to drift towards the target landing position.

#### 6. **Payload Specifications**

**Mass:** **0.5 kg** to keep the overall rocket mass low, enhancing thrust-to-weight ratio.
**Position:** **0.75 meters** relative to the rocket center to maintain balance and stability.

**Selection Criteria:**

- **Apogee Achievement:** The motor must provide sufficient thrust and burn time to reach the target apogee of 1000 meters.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Cheaper motors are preferred to maximize the cost-efficiency score.
- **Landing Safety:** Moderate thrust ensures better control over descent velocities.

**Analysis:**

- **High-Thrust Motors (CesaroniO3700 & CesaroniO5800):** Provide excessive thrust, leading to potential overshooting of the apogee and high landing velocities, which could compromise safety.
  
- **Low-Thrust Motors (AeroTechH128W & CesaroniK160):** Insufficient thrust to reach the target apogee reliably.

- **Balanced Options:**
  - **Pro75M1670 & CesaroniM1670:** Both offer 2200 N thrust with similar performance, providing a good balance between sufficient thrust and cost.
  - **AeroTechK700W:** Offers moderate thrust with better cost efficiency compared to higher thrust options.

**Chosen Motor:** **Pro75M1670**

**Rationale:**

- **Thrust:** 2200 N is sufficient to achieve the target apogee without causing excessive velocities that may lead to high impact speeds.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Lower cost compared to high-thrust motors.
- **Burn Time:** 3.9 seconds provides a controlled ascent phase.

---

#### **5. Launch Rail Configuration**

**Specifications:**

- **Rail Length:** **1.5 meters**

  Provides sufficient guidance during the initial thrust phase to maintain vertical alignment.

- **Inclination:** **90 degrees**

  Ensures a vertical launch to minimize horizontal drift.

- **Heading:** **45 degrees**

  Adjusted to account for wind conditions (5 m/s from East) aiming towards the target coordinates (3000m, 5000m).

**Rationale:**

Launching at a **45-degree heading** towards the Northwest compensates for the Eastward wind, directing the rocket's trajectory towards the target landing position.

---

#### **6. Payload Specifications**

**Specifications:**

- **Mass:** **0.4 kg**

  Lightweight payload to maintain an optimal thrust-to-weight ratio.

- **Position:** **0.5 meters**

  Positioned near the center of mass to ensure balance and stability.

---

#### **7. Wind Compensation and Landing Accuracy**

**Wind Conditions:**

- **Wind Speed:** 5 m/s from East.

**Flight Duration Estimate:**

Assuming total flight time (ascent + descent) of approximately **120 seconds**.

**Wind Drift Calculation:**

- **Horizontal Drift:** Wind can cause the rocket to drift horizontally during ascent and descent.

- **Total Drift:** 5 m/s * 120 s = **600 meters** towards West.

**Adjusted Launch Heading:**

To land at **(3000m, 5000m)**, adjust the launch heading to **approximately 53 degrees** towards Northeast. This accounts for the westward drift, ensuring that the resultant landing position aligns with the target coordinates.
