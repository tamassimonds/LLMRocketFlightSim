In designing the rocket, we need to ensure it meets several key requirements: it must reach a target apogee, land close to specified coordinates, handle wind conditions, maintain safety during landing, and be cost-effective. 

### 1. Motor Selection
Given the available motors, a suitable choice is the **CesaroniM1670**. This motor has:
- Max thrust: 2200 N
- Avg thrust: 1533.9 N
- Total impulse: 6023.6 Ns
- Isp: 198 s

#### Rationale:
The total impulse is adequate for achieving the desired apogee, while the thrust capabilities allow for good control during ascent and descent.

### 2. Rocket Body
To start, we need to calculate the required body dimensions. It has to accommodate the motor, provide structural integrity, and ensure aerodynamic efficiency.

#### Body Dimensions:
- Radius: 0.085 m (85 mm) - This is greater than the motor's radius (75 mm).
- Length: 1.0 m
- Material: **fiberglass**
- Wall thickness: 0.005 m 

#### Rationale:
Fiberglass provides a good balance between weight and structural integrity, which is essential for the flight.

### 3. Nose Cone
For the nose cone, an ogive shape is optimal for reducing drag during ascent.

#### Nose Cone Dimensions:
- Kind: **ogive**
- Length: 0.3 m
- Material: **fiberglass**

#### Rationale:
An ogive shape minimizes drag and allows for favorable aerodynamic profiles.

### 4. Fin Design
Stability can be enhanced by using four fins.

#### Fin Dimensions:
- Number: 4
- Root chord: 0.15 m
- Tip chord: 0.075 m
- Span: 0.5 m
- Cant angle: 0.0° (no cant)
- Material: **carbon_fiber**
- Thickness: 0.005 m

#### Rationale:
This fin configuration achieves stability while minimizing drag, and carbon fiber offers excellent strength with minimal weight.

### 5. Parachute Specifications
We will include a main parachute that deploys at apogee and optionally a drogue chute for added safety.

#### Parachute Specifications:
- Main parachute:
  - Name: **Main**
  - Cd_s: 0.15 m² (approximate for a medium-sized parachute)
  - Trigger: **apogee**
  - Sampling rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

- Drogue parachute:
  - Name: **Drogue**
  - Cd_s: 0.05 m² (smaller for rapid descent)
  - Trigger: **apogee**
  - Sampling rate: 105
  - Lag: 1.5
  - Noise: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

### 6. Launch Rail Configuration
The launch rail will be configured vertically.

#### Launch Configuration:
- Rail length: 3.0 m 
- Inclination: 90° 
- Heading: 0°

### 7. Payload
For payload specifications, a reasonable mass can be 1.0 kg, placed at the center for stability.
