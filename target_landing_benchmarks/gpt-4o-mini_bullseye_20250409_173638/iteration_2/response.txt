To design an improved rocket based on the specified requirements and the need to achieve optimal landing accuracy, we will analyze and adjust the rocket's components accordingly.

### Key Constraints and Factors

1. **Target Landing Position**: (3000.0 m East, 5000.0 m North)
2. **Wind Conditions**: 20 m/s from the East (considered in our calculations for stability)
3. **Apogee Needs**: The rocket must reach a target apogee specific to ensure it has sufficient altitude for a controlled descent.
4. **Cost**: We need to ensure that the total cost of the rocket remains efficient.
5. **Safety**: The rocket must land safely below 5 m/s.

We will ensure each design choice addresses these factors, balancing performance, stability, and safety.

### 1. Motor Selection

**Motor Choice**: **CesaroniM1670**

- **Parameters**:
  - Max Thrust: 2200 N
  - Average Thrust: 1533.9 N
  - Total Impulse: 6023.6 Ns
  - Isp: 198 s

**Rationale**: This motor provides a robust thrust-to-weight ratio capable of reaching a moderate apogee while also having good control over thrust, which is essential for mitigating effects of the wind at the descent phase.

### 2. Rocket Body Dimensions and Material

**Body Dimensions**:
- **Radius**: 0.09 m (90 mm) - This is greater than the motor's radius (75 mm).
- **Length**: 1.2 m
- **Material**: **fiber glass**
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m

**Rationale**: The increased body radius enhances stability and reduces drag, while fiberglass provides excellent structural integrity.

### 3. Nose Cone Dimensions and Material

**Nose Cone**:
- **Kind**: **ogive**
- **Length**: 0.4 m
- **Material**: **composite**

**Rationale**: An ogive shape is aerodynamic and helps optimize ascent while limiting drag during the descent phase. The length assists in mitigating drag under varying wind conditions.

### 4. Fin Design and Material

**Fin Design**:
- **Number**: 4
- **Root Chord**: 0.15 m
- **Tip Chord**: 0.075 m
- **Span**: 0.4 m
- **Cant Angle**: 0.0° (no cant)
- **Material**: **carbon_fiber**
- **Thickness**: 0.005 m

**Rationale**: This configuration ensures stability throughout flight phases while maintaining a lightweight structure due to carbon fiber properties.

### 5. Parachute Specifications

**Parachute Specifications**:
- **Main**:
  - **Cd_s**: 0.25 m² (to provide sufficient drag for optimal descent control)
  - **Trigger**: **apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate**: 105
  - **Lag**: 1.5
  - **Noise**: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

- **Drogue**:
  - **Cd_s**: 0.15 m² (smaller to initiate descent protection)
  - **Trigger**: **apogee**
  - **Sampling Rate**: 105
  - **Lag**: 1.5
  - **Noise**: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

**Rationale**: This parachute design maximizes descent safety and landing accuracy, compensating for wind effects by allowing for gradual velocity reduction.

### 6. Launch Rail Configuration

**Launch Configuration**:
- **Rail Length**: 2.5 m 
- **Inclination**: 90° 
- **Heading**: 0° (Directly upward)

**Rationale**: A vertical launch minimizes wind disturbances at launch, allowing for a stable ascent trajectory.

### 7. Payload Specifications

**Payload Specifications**:
- **Mass**: 0.5 kg 
- **Position**: 0.6 m (relative to rocket center)

**Rationale**: Lightweight payload ensures minimum impact to thrust requirements while keeping the center of mass favorable for stability.

### Summary of Design Choices

This design focuses on achieving balance between thrust, structural integrity, aerodynamics, and safety. The selected motor provides sufficient impulse to reach and stabilize at a target apogee. The use of advanced materials and parachute specifications ensures a controlled landing, optimizing for wind conditions while remaining cost-effective. With these adjustments, the rocket is not only designed to meet the landing requirements at (3000.0m, 5000.0m) but also perform effectively across all provided parameters.
