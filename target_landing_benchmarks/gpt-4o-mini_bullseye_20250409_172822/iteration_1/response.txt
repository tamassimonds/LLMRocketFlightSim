To design a rocket that meets the specified requirements, we need to consider several key elements, including the motor choice, body dimensions, aerodynamic features (nose cone and fins), parachute specifications, and launch rail configuration. The goal is to strike a balance between reaching the target apogee (3000.0m, 5000.0m), landing safely, and minimizing cost while preventing structural failure.

### Step 1: Motor Selection

From the list of available motors, the **Cesaroni O5800** has the highest thrust but also comes with a higher cost. The **AeroTech K700W** provides sufficient thrust for a reasonable altitude while being relatively lightweight and cost-effective.

### Step 2: Rocket Body

To achieve a target apogee of around 3000m, we need a sturdy but light rocket. Based on the thrust-to-weight ratio calculations, I recommend:

- **Body Radius**: 0.1m (greater than the motor radius which is 0.075m)
- **Body Length**: 1.5m (to maintain structural integrity and enough volume for stability)
- **Material**: **fiberglass** (it's strong but lightweight)
- **Thickness**: 0.005m

### Step 3: Nose Cone Design

For aerodynamic efficiency, I recommend a conical nose cone:

- **Type**: Conical
- **Length**: 0.3m
- **Material**: fiberglass (to keep the weight down)

### Step 4: Fin Design

Stability during flight is crucial, and good fin design will help achieve it. I recommend:

- **Number of Fins**: 4 
- **Root Chord**: 0.15m
- **Tip Chord**: 0.075m
- **Span**: 0.3m
- **Cant Angle**: 0 degrees (for better stability)
- **Material**: carbon_fiber (strong and lightweight)
- **Thickness**: 0.005m

### Step 5: Parachute Specifications

For the parachute, a main and drogue parachute will help manage descent:

- **Main Parachute**:
    - **Name**: Main
    - **Cd_s**: 0.5 (a standard size for a rocket of this scale)
    - **Trigger**: apogee
    - **Sampling Rate**: 105
    - **Lag**: 1.5 seconds
    - **Noise**: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

- **Drogue Parachute**:
    - **Name**: Drogue
    - **Cd_s**: 0.3 (slightly smaller than the main parachute for initial descent)
    - **Trigger**: apogee
    - **Sampling Rate**: 105
    - **Lag**: 1.5 seconds
    - **Noise**: (0, 8.3, 0.5)

### Step 6: Launch Rail Configuration

For the launch rail:

- **Rail Length**: 3m (long enough for a stable launch)
- **Inclination**: 90 degrees (a vertical launch is ideal)
- **Heading**: 0 degrees (straight up)

### Step 7: Payload

Assuming a lightweight payload to ensure the rocket can reach the intended apogee:

- **Mass**: 0.5 kg (standard for small rockets)
- **Position**: 0.0 m (center)

### Final Design Configuration

Combining all of these elements together results in the following configuration:

### Conclusion
