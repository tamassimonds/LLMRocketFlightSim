**Rocket Design Reasoning**

Designing a rocket to achieve a target apogee of 1000 meters while ensuring cost efficiency, safety, and precise landing requires careful consideration of each component. Below is a step-by-step reasoning for the design choices made:

### 1. Motor Selection
**Available Motors:**
- **CesaroniO5800**
  - **Total Impulse (Ns):** 30,382.7
  - **Average Thrust (N):** 5040.2
  - **Burn Time (s):** 5.2
  - **Mass (kg):** 12.418

**Reasoning:**
To reach an apogee of 1000 meters, a motor with sufficient total impulse is essential. The `CesaroniO5800` offers a high total impulse, ensuring enough thrust to propel the rocket to the desired altitude. Although it is one of the heavier motors, its high performance justifies the choice for achieving the target apogee.

### 2. Rocket Body Dimensions and Material
- **Body Radius:** 0.15 meters
- **Body Length:** 1.5 meters
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber
- **Wall Thickness:** 0.005 meters

**Reasoning:**
A body radius of 0.15 meters ensures it is larger than the motor radius (0.075 meters), adhering to design constraints. Carbon fiber is chosen for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio, minimizing the overall mass while maintaining structural integrity. A length of 1.5 meters provides adequate space for payload and stability.

### 3. Nose Cone Dimensions and Material
- **Kind:** Ogive
- **Length:** 0.3 meters
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber

**Reasoning:**
An ogive nose cone is selected for its aerodynamic efficiency, reducing drag and contributing to a stable flight path. Carbon fiber material ensures durability and minimal weight addition.

### 4. Fin Design and Material
- **Number of Fins:** 4
- **Root Chord:** 0.15 meters
- **Tip Chord:** 0.075 meters
- **Span:** 0.3 meters
- **Cant Angle:** 5 degrees
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber
- **Thickness:** 0.005 meters

**Reasoning:**
Four fins provide symmetrical stability, essential for accurate flight and landing. The dimensions are optimized for balance between aerodynamic efficiency and structural strength. Carbon fiber fins ensure lightweight and durable construction.

### 5. Tail Design
- **Length:** 0.2 meters
- **Top Radius:** 0.04 meters
- **Bottom Radius:** 0.05 meters
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber

**Reasoning:**
A tapered tail with different top and bottom radii prevents structural errors during design runs. Carbon fiber is used to maintain strength while keeping the tail lightweight.

### 6. Parachute Specifications
- **Main Parachute CD_s:** 0.25
- **Drogue Parachute CD_s:** 0.2
- **Trigger:** Apogee
- **Sampling Rate:** 105 Hz
- **Lag:** 1.5 seconds
- **Noise:** (0, 8.3, 0.5)

**Reasoning:**
The main parachute ensures a safe landing by reducing impact velocity below 5 m/s. The drogue parachute provides stability during descent. The specified parameters ensure reliable deployment and effective noise filtering for accurate triggering.

### 7. Launch Rail Configuration
- **Rail Length:** 1.2 meters
- **Inclination:** 90 degrees (Vertical Launch)
- **Heading:** 0 degrees (Straight Up)

**Reasoning:**
A vertical launch minimizes horizontal displacement, essential for landing accuracy. A 1.2-meter rail provides sufficient guidance during the initial phase of the launch, ensuring stability.

### 8. Payload Specifications
- **Mass:** 0.5 kg
- **Position:** 0.6 meters relative to rocket center

**Reasoning:**
A lightweight payload ensures that the rocket remains within the mass constraints for optimal performance. Positioning the payload towards the front balances the center of gravity, enhancing stability.

### Summary of Design Choices
- **Motor:** Selected for high total impulse to achieve target apogee.
- **Materials:** Carbon fiber chosen for its superior strength-to-weight ratio.
- **Dimensions:** Optimized for stability, aerodynamic efficiency, and compliance with design constraints.
- **Parachutes and Launch Configuration:** Designed to ensure safe and accurate landing.

The final design adheres to all specified requirements and constraints, ensuring feasibility and optimal performance in simulations.
