To design a rocket that meets the specified criteria, we need to keep in mind several factors including the motor choice, body dimensions, material selection, aerodynamic components, parachute specifications, and launch configuration. Below is the plan considering all the requirements:

### Step 1: Motor Selection
Given the requirements for a target apogee of 1000.0 meters, I will start by examining the thrust and burn time of the available motors. The motor must provide sufficient thrust to reach the desired altitude while allowing for a safe descent.

The **CesaroniO5800** provides a maximum thrust of 6395.5 N and a burn time of 5.2 seconds, which seems adequate. The impulse is also very high at 30,382.7 Ns, making it a good candidate for achieving the desired apogee. 

### Step 2: Rocket Body Design
The body radius must be greater than the motor radius, which is 0.075 meters for the **CesaroniO5800**. I will choose a body radius of **0.1 m** to ensure structural integrity and minimize drag. The body length would be **1.5 m**, providing enough volume for structural components and ensuring stability.

The body will be made from **fiberglass** due to its strength-to-weight ratio and sufficient stiffness.

- **Thickness**: At **0.005 m**, this would provide enough structural strength while keeping weight low.

### Step 3: Nose Cone Design
To minimize drag, a **conical nose cone** is effective. The length will be **0.3 m**, which is a reasonable size for a rocket of this diameter. The material will also be **fiberglass** for consistency in structural properties.

### Step 4: Fin Design
Four fins will provide stability during ascent and descent. Choosing a **root chord** of **0.15 m**, a **tip chord** of **0.075 m**, and a **span** of **0.25 m** will ensure that the fins are effective without being overly heavy. The fins will be **carbon_fiber** for additional rigidity and light weight.

### Step 5: Tail Design
The tail will guide the airflow and helps stabilize the rocket. I will use a tail length of **0.2 m** with a top radius of **0.04 m** and a bottom radius of **0.06 m**, ensuring stability and proper airflow. The tail material will also be **fiberglass**.

### Step 6: Parachute Specifications
Given the need to land safely (less than 5 m/s), I will use a main parachute with a CD_s area of **0.5 m^2** to ensure a low descent rate. The deployment trigger will be set to "apogee" to guarantee that it opens at the correct time. A smaller drogue parachute will also be used with an area of **0.2 m^2**, to slow the rocket down further.

### Step 7: Launch Rail Configuration
The launch rail will be **2.0 m long** and set at an inclination of **90 degrees** for a vertical launch. The heading will also be set to **0 degrees** with respect to gravity.

### Payload Consideration
I will include a payload mass of **1 kg**, which can represent sensors or other equipment essential for the mission. The payload will be placed at **0.8 m** from the rocket's center to maintain balance.

### Final Configuration
Compiling all the design elements together, here is the configuration for the rocket:
