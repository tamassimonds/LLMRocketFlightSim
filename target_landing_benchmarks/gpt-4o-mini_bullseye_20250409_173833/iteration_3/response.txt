To achieve the target landing position of (3000.0m, 5000.0m) while ensuring a safe descent and correctly reaching the target apogee of 1000.0m, we will carefully analyze each component of the rocket design, making necessary adjustments based on previous attempts.

### Rocket Design Strategy

1. **Motor Selection**:
   For this design, I consider the **CesaroniO5800** motor which provides high thrust but can potentially create high velocities. However, I'm looking for a balance of thrust to ensure the rocket reaches the desired height and safely descends. Given the high thrust of this motor, I'll ensure the rocket's design allows for a controlled descent phase.

2. **Rocket Body Design**:
   - **Radius**: Set at **0.15 m**, which is comfortably above the motor's radius (0.075 m).
   - **Length**: A length of **2.0 m** provides enough room for structural components along with a reasonable weight distribution.
   - **Material**: I'll select **fiberglass** for a mix of durability and weight.

3. **Nose Cone Design**:
   - The design will utilize an **ogive shape** for better aerodynamics.
   - **Length**: Set at **0.4 m**, which is effective for minimizing drag during ascent and descent, allowing for a better flight profile.

4. **Fin Design**:
   - I will use **4 triangular fins** to enhance stability.
   - **Root Chord**: Set at **0.20 m** with **tip chord** of **0.10 m** and span of **0.25 m**. This will ensure stability at high velocities and reduce oscillations.
   - **Material**: Carbon fiber is selected for its strong and lightweight nature.

5. **Tail Design**:
   - The tail section will have a length of **0.2 m**, a **top radius of 0.05 m** and a **bottom radius of 0.06 m**. Differentiating the radii helps with the airflow management.

6. **Parachute Specifications**:
   - For the main parachute, I select a **CD_s of 0.6 m²** to ensure a slow descent speed. Additionally, a drogue parachute with **CD_s of 0.3** m² will assist in slowing down during the initial descent.
   - Both parachutes will be configured to deploy at apogee to ensure a controlled descent.

7. **Launch Rail Configuration**:
   - The launch rail will remain at **2.0 m** and be oriented vertically (90 degrees inclination). The heading is kept at **0 degrees** for straightforward ascent.

8. **Payload Consideration**:
   - The payload will be **0.5 kg** and positioned **0.75 m** from the center to balance the rocket properly.

### Final Configuration

With all considerations made, the following configuration can be implemented:
