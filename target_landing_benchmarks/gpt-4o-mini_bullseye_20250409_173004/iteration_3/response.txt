To enhance the rocket design for landing closer to the coordinates (3000.0 m, 5000.0 m), while ensuring all operational parameters are met, we must carefully balance thrust, stability, and drift caused by wind conditions. Here’s a revised strategy based on previous attempts and considerations of aerodynamics, thrust requirements, and structural integrity:

### Goals and Constraints Review
1. **Target Landing Position**: (3000.0 m, 5000.0 m)
2. **Wind Conditions**: 20 m/s from the East (this affects the initial trajectory and descent).
3. **Landing Speed**: Must be under 5 m/s.
4. **Structural Integrity**: Zero structural failures during the flight.
5. **Cost Effectiveness**: Aim for a lower total cost.

### Design Decisions & Optimizations

#### Motor Selection
Motor choice is critical for achieving the necessary apogee. 
- **CesaroniM1670** motor is selected. It offers sufficient thrust with balance between performance and safety. It produces a maximum thrust of 2200 N and is capable of achieving the required apogee without excessive speed.

#### Rocket Body Dimensions and Material
1. **Radius**: 0.1 m (100 mm). This is just above the motor radius of 0.075 m.
2. **Length**: 1.5 m – provides adequate interior space for components while maintaining structural integrity.
3. **Material**: **Carbon Fiber** – chosen for its high strength-to-weight ratio and durability.
4. **Thickness**: 0.005 m – provides adequate strength without compromising weight significantly.

#### Nose Cone Design
Opt for an **ogive shape** for reduced drag.
- **Length**: 0.4 m.
- **Material**: Carbon Fiber to maintain consistency and structural integrity.

#### Fin Design
Enhanced stability and control are crucial.
1. **Number of Fins**: 4.
2. **Fin Dimensions**: 
   - Root Chord: **0.2 m**.
   - Tip Chord: **0.1 m**.
   - Span: **0.4 m**.
   - **Cant Angle**: 3 degrees to counteract wind drift.
   
3. **Material**: **Carbon Fiber**.
4. **Thickness**: 0.005 m.

#### Tail Design
The tail impacts stability during flight and descent.
1. **Length**: 0.3 m.
2. **Top Radius**: 0.08 m.
3. **Bottom Radius**: 0.1 m.
4. **Material**: Carbon Fiber.

#### Parachute Specifications
Key to ensuring a gentle landing:
1. **Main Parachute**: 
   - Area: **0.5 m²** (to sufficiently slow descent).
   - Trigger at apogee.
   
2. **Drogue Parachute**:
   - Area: **0.15 m²**.
   - Also deploy at apogee for stability.

#### Launch Rail Configuration
1. **Rail Length**: 2.5 m for adequate launch stability.
2. **Inclination**: 85 degrees to accommodate for wind.
3. **Heading**: -45 degrees to counteract eastward drift from wind.

#### Payload Specifications
1. **Mass**: 0.6 kg – balanced enough for impact control.
2. **Position**: Center position at 0.5 m.

### Final Configuration

### Conclusion
This design aims to tightly meet the requirements while optimizing for performance and safety. By accounting for wind drift and ensuring structural integrity through advanced materials, the rocket should perform competitively in the simulations. Given adjustments and precise calculations, we expect a substantial improvement in the overall landing accuracy closer to the target position (3000.0 m, 5000.0 m).
