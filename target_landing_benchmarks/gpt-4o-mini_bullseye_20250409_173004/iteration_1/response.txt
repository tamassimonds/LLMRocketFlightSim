To design a rocket optimized for the given requirements, let’s analyze the constraints and components available, along with the flight physics involved.

### Goals and Constraints
1. **Target Landing Position**: (3000.0 m, 5000.0 m)
2. **Wind Conditions**: 20 m/s from the East (which means the rocket will drift westward during descent).
3. **Landing Speed**: Must be less than 5 m/s.
4. **Structural Integrity**: The rocket must not suffer structural failure.
5. **Cost Efficiency**: The design should aim for a lower cost.

Given the expected wind conditions, we also have to take into account the lateral drift and plan accordingly.

### Selection of Motor
Choosing an appropriate motor is crucial for achieving the apogee while ensuring manageable costs and thrust. 

Based on the given motors:
- **CesaroniM1670** and **CesaroniO5800** provide the highest thrust. However, the **CesaroniO5800** would likely be overkill, resulting in a very high ascent speed and a risk of structural failure.
- **AeroTechK700W** or **CesaroniM1670** would be reasonable options with sufficient thrust to reach the target apogee.

After consideration, I will choose the **CesaroniM1670** motor for this design due to balancing thrust and controlled burn time.

### Body Dimensions and Material
Next, I chose the rocket body:
- **Radius**: To ensure stability and to accommodate the motor, I will choose a radius slightly larger than the motor radius.
  - Radius of motor (75 mm): Therefore, I’ll choose a body radius of **0.08 m**.
- **Length**: I will set a length of about **1.5 m** to maintain a stable center of gravity.
- **Material**: I prefer using **fiberglass** due to its strength-to-weight ratio and cost-efficiency.
- **Wall Thickness**: I will choose a thickness of **0.005 m** for the body.

### Nose Cone Design
For the nose cone, I will select an **ogive shape** due to its aerodynamic properties:
- **Length**: I will set this to **0.3 m**.
- **Material**: I will use **fiberglass** to keep the weight down.

### Fin Design
Fins will provide stability during flight. 
- **Number of Fins**: I’ll opt for **4 fins** to ensure good stability.
- **Fin Dimensions**: 
  - Root chord: **0.15 m**
  - Tip chord: **0.075 m**
  - Span: **0.3 m**
  - Cant angle: **0 degrees** (for a stable flight).
- **Material**: I will again choose **fiberglass** for its lightness and stability characteristics.
- **Thickness**: I’ll keep it consistent at **0.005 m**.

### Tail Design
The tail will have a specific design to ensure stability while not contributing considerably to the drag.
- **Length**: **0.3 m**
- **Top radius**: **0.065 m**
- **Bottom radius**: **0.075 m**
- **Material**: **fiberglass** for consistency.

### Parachute Specifications
Effective parachutes are necessary for controlled descent:
- **Main parachute** area: **0.25 m²** 
- **Drogue parachute** area: **0.15 m²**
Both will deploy at apogee for safety.

### Launch Rail Configuration
- **Rail length**: **2.5 m** for stability during the initial launch.
- **Inclination**: **90 degrees** for straight-up launch.
- **Heading**: **0 degrees** for initial vertical trajectory without wind adjustment initially.

### Payload
- **Mass**: I’ll specify a mass of **0.5 kg**.
- **Position**: I will center it at **0.5 m** from the center for balance.

### Final Configuration
Taking all these into account, the configuration can be summarized as follows:
