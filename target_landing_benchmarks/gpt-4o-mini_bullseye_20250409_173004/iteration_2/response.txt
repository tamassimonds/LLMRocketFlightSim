To improve the rocket design and enhance the likelihood of landing close to the target position (3000.0 m, 5000.0 m), we'll need to make adjustments considering the impact of wind, the vertical and horizontal components, apogee aiming, and descent control. Here’s the detailed reasoning process and revised design choices based on the previous attempt and required adjustments.

### Goals and Constraints
1. **Target Landing Position**: (3000.0 m, 5000.0 m) means accounting for a wind drift due to 20 m/s wind from the East.
2. **Wind Drift Adjustment**: The rocket will drift approximately with the wind during descent. We need to account for this in the initial launch trajectory.
3. **Landing Speed**: Must be lower than 5 m/s to land safely.
4. **Structural Integrity**: Ensure no failure during the flight.
5. **Cost**: Maintain a cost below the threshold while optimizing for performance.

### Design Approach

#### Motor Selection
Choosing the **CesaroniO5800** motor to maximize thrust while maintaining the descent phase control. Although it’s a heavier motor, we expect the sufficient thrust will help clear the 3000 m apogee easily and adjust better for wind drift control.

#### Body Dimensions and Material
- **Radius**: Selecting a body radius of **0.1 m** (greater than the motor radius of 0.075 m).
- **Length**: Set at **1.8 m** to provide better structural stability and room for components.
- **Material**: Choosing **carbon_fiber** due to its lightweight attributes and better strength properties compared to fiberglass.
- **Wall Thickness**: Fixed at **0.005 m** for structural reliability.

#### Nose Cone Design
We would maintain an **ogive shape** for the nose cone, as it is aerodynamically efficient:
- **Length**: Set to **0.4 m** to reduce drag further.
- **Material**: Using **carbon_fiber** to maintain consistency with the body.

#### Fin Design
Fins will aid stability with added control during the descent phase.
- **Number of Fins**: Increase to **5 fins** for better control of the rocket trajectory.
- **Fin Dimensions**: 
  - Root Chord: **0.18 m**
  - Tip Chord: **0.09 m**
  - Span: **0.35 m**
  - Cant Angle: Set at **5 degrees** for inducing a slight roll for wind compensation.
- **Material**: Retaining **carbon_fiber** for overall weight reduction and performance.
- **Thickness**: Maintain **0.005 m**.

#### Tail Design
The tail will enhance stability as well:
- **Length**: Keep it at **0.4 m**.
- **Top Radius**: **0.07 m**
- **Bottom Radius**: **0.09 m**
- **Material**: Use **carbon_fiber** to stay consistent.

#### Parachute Specifications
To ensure a controlled descent:
- **Main parachute**: Area set at **0.4 m²** for effective descent control.
- **Drogue parachute**: Reduce to **0.2 m²**.
- Deploy both at apogee to ensure a moderated descent.

#### Launch Rail Configuration
- **Rail Length**: **3.5 m** for increased stability during launch.
- **Inclination**: **85 degrees** to adjust against the wind.
- **Heading**: Set at **-45 degrees** to counteract the eastward wind drift.

### Payload Specifications
- **Mass**: Specify at **0.7 kg** to ensure enough momentum without excessive weight.
- **Position**: Center the payload at **0.5 m** to keep balance.

### Final Configuration Summary
The revised design can be codified as follows:

### Conclusion
